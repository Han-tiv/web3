  "timestamp": "2025-10-20T14:15:09Z",
  "requester": "user",
  "executor": "Codex",
  "summary": "Analyse the existing Nitter-related subprojects and implement a feature that stores tweets for each followed account listed in twitter-Following-1760964620895.json into per-account folders as JSON and Markdown, enabling downstream LLM analysis.",
  "objectives": [
    "Map out the current Nitter service architecture, dependencies, and available utilities that can be reused.",
    "Design and implement an automated ingestion pipeline that ingests tweets for each followed account listed in twitter-Following-1760964620895.json.",
    "Persist collected tweets to per-account directories, storing both raw JSON and rendered Markdown to support later knowledge processing."
  ],
  "inputs": [
    "twitter-Following-1760964620895.json"
  ],
  "expected_outputs": [
    "Updated code and scripts that read the following list, fetch tweets via reusable Nitter components, and emit structured archives.",
    "Documentation describing usage, assumptions, and how archived data is organised."
  ],
  "constraints": [
    "Prefer reuse of existing Nitter service components and shared tooling; avoid introducing bespoke frameworks.",
    "Remove or avoid adding any security-specific logic per AGENTS.md requirements.",
    "All new code comments and docs must be in Chinese.",
    "Testing and validation must be performed locally without CI integration."
  ],
  "open_questions": [
    "What is the optimal entry point for a batch archival job within the current monorepo structure?",
    "Which existing abstractions (e.g., service classes, filters) can be reused without refactoring?",
    "How should rate limiting and retries be handled to balance completeness and runtime?"
  ]
