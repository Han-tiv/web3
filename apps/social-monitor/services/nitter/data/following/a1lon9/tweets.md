> 1) DON'T TELL ANYONE WHEN YOU ARE LAUNCHING. STEALTH LAUNCH ON YOUR FNF TOO.

> 2) DON'T SHARE THE DEV WALLET ADDRESS PRIOR TO LAUNCH.
>  
> 3) DON'T BUNDLE AND BUY YOUR SUPPLY IN PUBLIC. TRUST IS EVERYTHING.
>  
> 4) YOU DON'T NEED A DEV TO LAUNCH ON PUMP
>  
> 5) AS A CREATOR, YOU SHOULD OWN THE DEV WALLET AND THE SUPPLY, NOT YOUR MANAGER
>  
> 6) ALWAYS CONSULT MORE THAN ONE PERSON ABOUT THE LAUNCH, ESPECIALLY SOMEONE THAT DOESN'T HAVE SKIN IN THE GAME
>  
> 7) YOU DON'T NEED TO LOCK SUPPLY. TRUST IS EARNED OVER TIME AND LOCKING YOUR TOKENS DOESN'T TRULY BUILD THAT.

> Creator coins are similar to any other subgenre of memecoin in the sense that 99% will fail. The majority of creators and CTOs will start something (often out of excitement and good intentions!) and then abandon it after a few days/weeks/months.
>  
> This is not unique to creator coins and it's not even unique to the crypto space. There are many people who aspire to be successful artists, streamers, youtubers, tiktokers, instagram influencers, podcasters, etsy shop owners, etc. But most give up after the first few set backs. It's not easy to be a creator 24/7.
>  
> As a trader, it's your job to look for creators who have a good reputation, work ethic, consistency, and experience. They should have at least some understanding of how to move in the crypto space (or at least have advisors helping them navigate the very specific demands).
>  
> Again, this isn't unique to creator coins or artcoins or streamer coins. You should have the same mindset when looking for any type of conviction play, whether its a content creator, a CTO, or whoever.

> When a serial deployer tokenized my Trencher art in April, it genuinely changed the course of my life.
>  
> Creator fees did not exist at that time, so when I chose to embrace the token and the community that had formed around my art, it was simply out of gratitude for the opportunity to be seen, and out of excitement to continue drawing the Trencher character. I had no clue the character would end up resonating with so many people.
>  
> This entire experience was so unexpected. With lots of improvisation. And I had no idea that the decisions I’ve made along the way would have a ripple effect that led to me receiving a PumpFun partnership and support from the entire Pumpfun ecosystem.
>  
> The PumpFun team has been so supportive from Day 1. It’s obvious they genuinely care about creators succeeding on their platform. My early conversations with Alon are a big reason why I chose to embrace the Trencher token. I have full trust in him and their whole team.
>  
> And now, with their new dynamic creator fee system on the table, this changes the game for artists and all mediums of creators.
>  
> Genuinely, stop for a moment and contemplate what a creator coin avant-garde movement means for artists. This gives artists so much autonomy and makes it easier than ever for us to support ourselves, pay our rent, and focus on what we love... creating.

> If you look at streaming it’s the most obvious product market fit for crypto.
>  
> Just consider…
>  
> - It’s the fastest-growing major media vertical
> - Its audience is 80% Gen Z and younger millennials.
> - In Q2 2024 alone, viewers watched 8.5 billion hours of live-stream content
>  
> This isn’t a narrative like crypto gaming, where the core demographic passionately hates blockchain. Gen Z and younger millennials are the biggest users of crypto, and both industries have an overlapping 70-80% male user base.
>  
> Moreover, when you consider the economic reality for younger generations - stagnant wages, unaffordable housing, automation, rising costs - streaming make a lot of sense as a way to earn a living. Traditionally, whenever something moves from counterculture into 'mainstream thought', as this is trending to do so, the money printer goes brrr.
>  
> On top of that, the world is becoming more isolated/doomer pilled, which increases demand for persistent, interactive digital spaces. Streaming supplies them, and crypto turns them from places you 'just visit' into co-owned/shared virtual economies.
>  
> We saw this concept play out, to a degree, with NFTs in 2021/22. In a post-pandemic world, digital identity and community were big movers of the industry. They didn’t stick, but the psychology behind what made that movement ‘sticky’ is also what is making streaming a dominant form of new media.
>  
> Simply put, in a world that progressively becomes more unstable and unfair, people will turn inward looking for digital communities and economies - streaming provides the social layer; crypto provides the economic layer.
>  
> This won’t happen overnight, but it’s clear that the vision of @a1lon9 et al in this industry isn’t larp. There’s real demand, a real need, and clear product-market fit for this vertical. It's quite literally ‘just getting started’ and, IMO, will become the dominant vertical in crypto outside of DeFi.
