STEALTH LAUNCH ON YOUR FNF TOO.\n\n2) DON'T SHARE THE DEV WALLET ADDRESS PRIOR TO LAUNCH.\n\n3) DON'T BUNDLE AND BUY YOUR SUPPLY IN PUBLIC. TRUST IS EVERYTHING.\n\n4) YOU DON'T NEED A DEV TO LAUNCH ON PUMP\n\n5) AS A CREATOR, YOU SHOULD OWN THE DEV WALLET AND THE SUPPLY, NOT YOUR MANAGER\n\n6) ALWAYS CONSULT MORE THAN ONE PERSON ABOUT THE LAUNCH, ESPECIALLY SOMEONE THAT DOESN'T HAVE SKIN IN THE GAME\n\n7) YOU DON'T NEED TO LOCK SUPPLY. TRUST IS EARNED OVER TIME AND LOCKING YOUR TOKENS DOESN'T TRULY BUILD THAT. \n\nIf you need help, my DMs are ALWAYS open",

There are many people who aspire to be successful artists, streamers, youtubers, tiktokers, instagram influencers, podcasters, etsy shop owners, etc. But most give up after the first few set backs. It's not easy to be a creator 24/7.\n\nAs a trader, it's your job to look for creators who have a good reputation, work ethic, consistency, and experience. They should have at least some understanding of how to move in the crypto space (or at least have advisors helping them navigate the very specific demands). \n\nAgain, this isn't unique to creator coins or artcoins or streamer coins. You should have the same mindset when looking for any type of conviction play, whether its a content creator, a CTO, or whoever.",

I had no clue the character would end up resonating with so many people.\n \nThis entire experience was so unexpected. With lots of improvisation. And I had no idea that the decisions I’ve made along the way would have a ripple effect that led to me receiving a PumpFun partnership and support from the entire Pumpfun ecosystem.\n \nThe PumpFun team has been so supportive from Day 1. It’s obvious they genuinely care about creators succeeding on their platform. My early conversations with Alon are a big reason why I chose to embrace the Trencher token. I have full trust in him and their whole team.\n \nAnd now, with their new dynamic creator fee system on the table, this changes the game for artists and all mediums of creators. \n \nGenuinely, stop for a moment and contemplate what a creator coin avant-garde movement means for artists. This gives artists so much autonomy and makes it easier than ever for us to support ourselves, pay our rent, and focus on what we love... creating.\n \nWe are so lucky to be here, lending our voices and skills to an evolving system of what will eventually be considered to be the future best practices of our industry.",

Gen Z and younger millennials are the biggest users of crypto, and both industries have an overlapping 70-80% male user base. \n\nMoreover, when you consider the economic reality for younger generations - stagnant wages, unaffordable housing, automation, rising costs - streaming make a lot of sense as a way to earn a living. Traditionally, whenever something moves from counterculture into 'mainstream thought', as this is trending to do so, the money printer goes brrr.\n\nOn top of that, the world is becoming more isolated/doomer pilled, which increases demand for persistent, interactive digital spaces. Streaming supplies them, and crypto turns them from places you 'just visit' into co-owned/shared virtual economies. \n\nWe saw this concept play out, to a degree, with NFTs in 2021/22. In a post-pandemic world, digital identity and community were big movers of the industry. They didn’t stick, but the psychology behind what made that movement ‘sticky’ is also what is making streaming a dominant form of new media.\n\nSimply put, in a world that progressively becomes more unstable and unfair, people will turn inward looking for digital communities and economies - streaming provides the social layer; crypto provides the economic layer. \n\nThis won’t happen overnight, but it’s clear that the vision of @a1lon9 et al in this industry isn’t larp. There’s real demand, a real need, and clear product-market fit for this vertical. It's quite literally ‘just getting started’ and, IMO, will become the dominant vertical in crypto outside of DeFi.",
