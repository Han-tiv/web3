>  
> 🌽 Limitless @trylimitless
>  
> Things are heating up with Limitless. After that public spat between its founder CJ, Binance, and CZ, he set up a bet: "Will Binance list $LMTS in 2025?" Then, he announced Limitless was deploying on BNB Chain.
>  
> Now, they've doubled down and added another bet: "Will 币安人生 get a spot listing on Binance in 2025?"
>  
> 📎 币安人生
>  
> Last night, Jesse @jessepollak posted a video tutorial on how to buy 币安人生 on BaseApp.
>  
> Today, CZ @cz_binance retweeted Jesse's post, noting that 币安人生 is the "first Chinese Ticker on Base App."
>  
> Just a few days ago, CZ posted that he would be buying some BNB Chain memes. With this new retweet, is 币安人生 going to be the next meme to get that coveted Binance spot listing?
>  
> 🧰 The Arena AI @the_nof1 Experiment
>  
> Alpha Arena has kicked off a fascinating AI experiment. They gave six of the biggest AI models—including ChatGPT, DeepSeek, and Grok—$10,000 in seed money each.
>  
> The goal? To have the AIs autonomously predict and trade the price action of BTC, ETH, SOL, BNB, DOGE, and XRP on Hyperliquid.
>  
> After just two days, DeepSeek and Grok are crushing it, having already racked up profits of $3,924 and $3,435, respectively.
>  
> ⏱️ Handle Marketplace @XHandles
>  
> X has officially announced the upcoming "Handle Marketplace," a new feature designed to redistribute long-inactive usernames.
>  
> According to the announcement, the marketplace will give Premium subscribers first dibs on searching for and requesting their desired handles, with both complimentary and paid options available.
>  
> The waitlist is now open, so regular users can sign up to be notified as soon as it opens to the public.
>  
> The above information is from the Xhunt plugin's list of trending topics and discussions.

> Biteye & XHunt | Crypto Trending Daily - October 16
>  
> 🤖 Brevis @brevis_zk
>  
> Brevis burst onto the scene, becoming one of the very few projects to get a dual endorsement from both Vitalik Buterin and the official Ethereum account, making it an instant market focus.
>  
> At its core, Brevis uses ZK technology for "off-chain compute, on-chain validation," a model designed to break the "impossible triangle" of on-chain computation and unlock infinite compute potential for smart contracts.
>  
> Right now, users can accumulate "Sparks" points through social tasks like check-ins and reposts. This is in preparation for Phase 2, which involves on-chain interactions starting November 3rd.
>  
> Heads up: These "Sparks" are directly linked to a future token allocation.
>  
> 🌈 Momentum @MMTFinance
>  
> Buildpad has teamed up with MMTFinance to introduce a brand-new "squad challenge" model for the $MMT launch. Users can form squads of up to 10 people to compete for priority allocation by co-creating content. Winning squads are guaranteed a non-diluted token allocation of at least $150.
>  
> To participate, you need to complete KYC and form a squad on the Buildpad website, then post content on X about the value of the MMT project (tagging the official accounts), and finally submit your post link on the event page before the deadline at  on October 22nd.
>  
> 🌇 MegaETH @megaeth_labs
>  
> MegaETH has kicked off a new public token sale on Echo's SONAR platform. This follows their $10 million community round on Echo in December 2024 and the roughly $28 million raised via an NFT public sale in February 2025.
>  
> For context, the last project to launch on this platform was the highly successful Plasma. For many in the crypto space, this makes the MegaETH sale a high-conviction play, IYKYK.
>  
> Users need to register between October 17-25 by going to the official website, proceeding to the Echo platform to complete KYC (Note: China is not supported), and linking their social accounts.
>  
> 🖼️ Believe @believeapp
>  
> The Believe project has rolled out a controversial "flywheel" update. The main changes include renaming the token from $LAUNCHCOIN to   $BELIEVE and increasing the total token supply by 25%. This move has been widely criticized by the community as a selfish act that harms loyal holders, as the 25% supply increase directly dilutes their assets and the extremely short migration window is seen as punishing.
>  
> All $LAUNCHCOIN holders must manually upgrade their tokens on the official website within four weeks to avoid a potential total loss of their assets.
>  
> The above information is from the Xhunt plugin's list of trending topics and discussions.

> 11/ Why are others ranked higher with fewer views and engagements?
> We also value engagement quality. Engagement from KOLs or influential users can lead to higher scores. Another possibility is that your account has been flagged as "farming," resulting in ranking penalties.

> 🔥Secondary Market Daily Report 04/01/2025
>  
> ⭐️Market Trend
> The cryptocurrency market is currently in an event-driven state, influenced by multiple factors. The Trump family's entry into Bitcoin mining has boosted market sentiment, but the overall market still faces challenges. Tariff policies, inflation expectations, GDP data, and other macroeconomic factors significantly impact market sentiment. Bitcoin price volatility is high, but long-term investors remain on the sidelines, with short-term investors dominating the market. The overall market difficulty has increased, and the relationship between rebounds and reversals requires careful observation.
>  
> ⭐️Major Coins
> $BTC is currently priced around $82,480, with a short-term downward bias. If the price rises above $82.3k, it may provide an opportunity to go long. MicroStrategy has again purchased a large amount of 22,048 BTC, showing institutional confidence. Rate cut expectations and fundamental support exist, but caution is needed regarding short-term correction risks.
>  
> $ETH is currently facing significant volatility, with prices having fallen to around $1,750, comparable to November 2023 levels. Whale selling and developer departures have intensified market concerns. In the short term, observation is recommended, considering buying on dips only after price stabilization.
>  
> $BNB has shown divergent performance recently, with short-term upward momentum, but altcoin options strategies generally showing short positions, indicating cautious market sentiment. Combined with frequent Binance ecosystem activities, such as the $BNB super gathering, there may be short-term rebound opportunities, but caution is needed regarding correction risks.
>  
> ⭐️Trending Coins
> $TON has recently demonstrated an upward trend independent of the market, despite the overall market downturn. Its on-chain wallet count has exceeded 41 million and continues to grow, showing a strong user base. With Telegram bonds reaching new highs and top institutions entering, the $TON ecosystem is in its early stages with significant growth space. Long-term potential is evident, and it's recommended to watch for low-level entry opportunities.
>  
> $VINE has performed strongly recently, driven by Elon Musk and xAI acquisition rumors, with prices soaring 130% in 3 days. If it breaks through 0.053, further rises are possible. Binance's large holdings have also enhanced market confidence. Short-term outlook is bullish, but caution is needed regarding market volatility.
>  
> $NIL currently has a market cap below $100 million and is listed on Binance, showing significant growth potential. Its Alpha mainnet has launched, focusing on the blind computing field for privacy protection, with solid technical fundamentals. Short-term price volatility is high, but the long-term outlook is positive, suitable for buying on dips.
>  
> Aster has recently completed a brand upgrade, integrating Astherus and APX, aiming to become a representative DEX on BNB Chain. CZ has expressed optimism multiple times, and with the points system and potential airdrops, the short-term outlook is bullish. Pay attention to TGE and exchange ratio announcements, which may bring trading opportunities.

> 🔥Secondary Market Daily Report 03/27/2025
>  
> ⭐️Market Trend
> The cryptocurrency market is currently showing signs of a rebound, but still faces critical technical tests, such as the 200-day MA/EMA and 2021 highs. Bulls need to hold key support areas and form higher lows during consolidation. Market sentiment is complex, with reflections on the future landscape of decentralized exchanges (DEXs) and centralized exchanges (CEXs), as well as concerns about market manipulation and moral dilemmas. Overall, the market remains in a state of volatility and uncertainty, requiring investors to proceed with caution.
>  
> ⭐️Major Coins
> $BTC is currently facing key resistance levels and may see a short-term correction. However, the long-term bullish trend remains unchanged, especially with its advantages as a store of value in the context of global inflation. It's recommended to buy on dips and watch the $86.5k support level.
>  
> $ETH has shown weak performance recently, with technical indicators suggesting a possible drop to $1,960 if support levels are broken. Despite reduced selling pressure from spot ETFs, buying volume remains low, possibly related to current narratives and liquidity issues. Long-term, $ETH still has potential as a computing operating system, but caution is needed in the short term.
>  
> $SOL has recently shown strong technical breakouts, rebounding from a descending wedge and returning to an upward channel, with a target price of $280. At the same time, multiple institutions are applying for spot ETFs, which if approved, will greatly enhance its status as a "commodity" and benefit long-term development. The current pullback is merely a phase adjustment, with medium to long-term upside potential still present.
>  
> $BNB has recently demonstrated strong technical aspects and ecosystem activity. From a technical analysis perspective, BNB is forming an ascending triangle, with a target price of around $690 if it breaks through. In terms of ecosystem, there are also clear signs of large capital accumulating at the bottom, with historical highs expected. It's recommended to pay attention to opportunities in the BNB chain ecosystem and buy on dips.
>  
> ⭐️Trending Coins
> $HYPE has recently experienced violent fluctuations due to market manipulation and exchange competition, but the cohesion and rapid response of the Hyperliquid community have demonstrated its potential. Short-term selling pressure is high, but if Hyperliquid can stabilize the situation, there may be rebound opportunities. Pay attention to the double bottom pattern and subsequent market sentiment changes.
>  
> $DOGE has performed strongly recently, with a nearly 10% increase in 24 hours, and is likely to continue upward after breaking through the key resistance level of $0.22. As the leader of the MEME sector, $DOGE's trend often guides other meme coins such as $SHIB and $PEPE. If market sentiment continues, $DOGE may further challenge the $0.245 resistance level, with more short-term trading opportunities.
>  
> $PEPE has performed strongly recently, with a 70-80% increase since bottoming out, showing strong market momentum. As the MEME sector strengthens overall, $PEPE, with its smaller market cap, offers higher volatility and potential returns. The short-term outlook is bullish, but caution is needed regarding correction risks from market sentiment fluctuations.
>  
> $BERA has shown strong recent performance with significant capital inflow, especially after Wasabi launched on Berachain, offering APYs of 50%-300%, attracting large deposits. Combined with the Proof of Liquidity mechanism and BGT incentives, $BERA has long-term growth potential. The current price is at a low level, suitable for buying on dips.

> 🔥 Secondary Market Daily Report 03/26/2025
>  
> ⭐️Market Trend
> The cryptocurrency market sentiment has recently improved, mainly influenced by Trump's softened stance on tariffs and his call for the Federal Reserve to lower interest rates, which has increased investors' risk appetite, leading to rises in both US stocks and Bitcoin. Additionally, expectations of a potential ceasefire in the Russia-Ukraine conflict have had a positive impact on market sentiment. However, the market is still in a rebound rather than a reversal trend, and investor concerns about a US economic recession persist.
>  
> ⭐️Major Coins
> $BTC recently faced rejection near its resistance trend line, but strong performance in network difficulty and hash rate reflects miner confidence and network resilience. Whale accumulation and companies like GameStop using Bitcoin as strategic reserves are positive factors for $BTC.
>  
> $ETH has shown weak recent performance, but its fundamentals remain strong, with ETF and infrastructure support making its long-term outlook positive. It may face pressure in the short term, but could see a rebound in Q2.
>  
> $SOL has performed strongly recently, breaking through the upper Bollinger Band, indicating upward momentum. Frequent large transfers may indicate institutional entry. Blackrock might apply for a $SOL ETF, further boosting market sentiment. In the short term, it's likely to continue upward.
>  
> $BNB has recently shown strong ecosystem growth potential due to zero-fee bridging activities and potential benefits in the Hong Kong market. In the short term, $BNB may continue to rise due to these positive factors. It's recommended to monitor on-chain activity and ecosystem project progress to capture trading opportunities.
>  
> ⭐️Trending Coins
> $SIREN has recently performed strongly in Binance listing votes, ranking second, with potential spot listing expectations driving up its price. As a leading AI project on BSC, its market cap has remained stable between $50-100 million, showing strong resistance to declines. In the short term, voting results and listing expectations may drive further increases, making it worth watching.
>  
> $NIL has shown strong recent performance, with mainnet launch and Bithumb exchange listing stabilizing its price. Blind computing technology demonstrates its unique value, but caution is needed regarding short-term volatility.
>  
> $DOGE has performed strongly recently, with prices breaking through a wedge formation, showing upside potential. The Dogecoin Foundation has established an "Official Dogecoin Reserve," enhancing market confidence. In the short term, $DOGE is expected to continue rising, especially against the backdrop of market recovery, making it worth attention.
>  
> $BERA has recently been driven by the Proof of Liquidity (PoL) program, with TVL hitting new highs and new projects like $DOLO launching, bringing strong capital inflows. Short-term outlook is bullish with a target price of $9.6, but caution is needed regarding market volatility. The PoL mechanism is attracting significant liquidity, with great potential for long-term ecosystem expansion.
>  
> $XRP is facing upward price pressure recently, and despite the SEC lawsuit nearing its end, market sentiment remains cautious. ETF expectations and institutional capital inflows may bring long-term benefits, but in the short term, attention should be paid to the key support level of $2.00. If broken, it could further drop to $2.38, while a rebound to $2.70 presents an opportunity. Caution is needed regarding market volatility risks.
>  
> $ALCH has performed strongly recently, with a 43.4% increase in 24 hours, mainly driven by Alchemist AI's release of Gemini Flash. The AI sector is rebounding overall, with $ALCH leading the way. From a technical perspective, the price has broken through its oscillation range and is likely to continue upward in the short term. It's recommended to watch for buying opportunities after pullbacks, but be cautious of market volatility risks.

> 🔥Secondary Market Daily Report 03/25/2025
>  
> ⭐️Market Trend
>  
> BTC, ETH, and SOL have recently rebounded, with overall market sentiment improving. In general, the market lacks liquidity, with major coins performing well, but altcoins and meme coins facing significant pressure.
>  
> ⭐️Major Coins
>  
> $BTC is currently facing resistance around 90k and needs to break through and stabilize above 92k to confirm an upward trend. Standard Chartered Bank views it as a tech stock rather than a safe-haven asset, suggesting its volatility may increase. Trump-related policies and state-level Bitcoin reserves could drive significant growth in Q3, with targets of 200K-250K. Caution is advised in the short term, but the long-term outlook remains positive.
>  
> $ETH supply has recently hit a 9-year low, with centralized exchanges holding only 8.97 million coins, indicating reduced selling pressure. If the SEC approves staking, prices could rise parabolically. Short-term target is $2,100, with a mid-term potential to reach $3,400.
>  
> $SOL has shown strong performance recently with a notable rebound and gradually increasing ecosystem activity. Positive news such as Polymarket integration and a Japanese real estate giant accepting $SOL payments has further strengthened its fundamentals. In the short term, $SOL is likely to continue upward, but caution is needed regarding potential corrections due to market volatility.
>  
> $BNB has recently benefited from Binance's frequent ecosystem activities and IDO launches, attracting many users and creating a bullish short-term outlook. The Trump family fund launching a stablecoin on the BNB chain has sparked controversy but increased on-chain activity. In the multi-chain rotation market, continuous positive developments in the BNB ecosystem may help it maintain strength.
>  
> ⭐️Trending Coins
>  
> $MUBARAK has recently received Binance liquidity support and high community attention, with potential listing expectations creating short-term speculation opportunities. However, market sentiment is volatile, and some investors have already taken profits, so be cautious of correction risks. Long-term, if its community-driven approach and ecosystem development continue, there may be further upside potential.
>  
> $NIL has just been listed on top exchanges including Binance, with its mainnet launching. It may face selling pressure in the short term, but the long-term outlook is positive. There's high demand for privacy computing infrastructure, the team has a strong background, and its FDV of $672.5 million is reasonable. Recommended to wait for price stabilization before investing, with high potential for a rebound.
>  
> $XRP has performed strongly recently, with Japanese real estate giant Open House Group accepting it as a payment method, further enhancing its utility. The SEC's withdrawal of its lawsuit against Ripple has brought regulatory clarity to $XRP, with trading volume surging 253%. Technical analysis shows $XRP breaking through the 4-hour trend line, with a target price of $2.70. Attention should be paid to its short-term growth potential.
>  
> $DOGE has performed strongly recently, breaking through a descending wedge with a target price of $0.434. Japanese real estate giant Open House Group now accepts $DOGE payments, further driving adoption. As the highest market cap meme coin, $DOGE has strong liquidity and celebrity support from figures like Elon Musk, with potential for continued growth. Short-term trading opportunities are evident, and buying on dips is recommended.
>  
> $TRUMP has recently gained attention due to Trump's endorsement and expectations of a 4% unlock. Despite high short-term volatility, whale purchases and narrative support still offer potential. Recommended to watch market reactions before and after the unlock.
>  
> $BERA has seen strong growth recently due to the launch of its Proof of Liquidity (PoL) system, with TVL exceeding $3.5 billion and extremely high market attention. In the short term, it could reach $10, but high volatility should be noted. Long-term, on-chain governance and ecosystem expansion provide fundamental support, making it worth continued attention.

> 🔥Secondary Market Daily Report 20250321
>  
> ⭐️Market Trend
>  
> The crypto market is currently in a consolidation phase, with no significant risks in the short term. Following the Fed’s interest rate decision, market expectations were unmet, leading some investors—especially short-term traders—to exit. Despite weak sentiment, the strong backing of stablecoins and Trump's support for crypto could provide future support. Overall, the market is still searching for clear direction, and investors should approach uncertainty cautiously.
>  
> ⭐️Major Coins
>  
> $BTC: Consolidating around $84K; holding the $84K-$85K range is crucial. A breakout above $89K-$90K could signal a reversal. Short-term correction risks remain, but the bull market is not over—buying on dips is a viable strategy.
>  
> $ETH: Showing strong technical support, with the 1H 200EMA acting as a key level. The introduction of staking functionality in ETFs will significantly boost $ETH’s attractiveness, particularly in comparison to traditional finance. Short-term focus is on $2K support, while long-term fundamentals remain strong.
>  
> $SOL: Signs of strong recovery, with $jitoSOL supply hitting an all-time high and expanded DeFi lending features enhancing its ecosystem value. However, market sentiment is mixed, with some investors taking profits and shorting around $135-$136. Short-term volatility is expected, but its position as a core Layer-1 project remains solid, making dips attractive for accumulation.
>  
> $BNB: Recent token launch events on Binance have driven increased user participation, leading to short-term demand spikes. Investors should watch for trading opportunities arising from these events while holding $BNB to capture long-term ecosystem benefits.
>  
> ⭐️Trending Coins
>  
> $XRP: Strong performance due to SEC lawsuit victory and ETF speculation. Price target: $2.68-$4. Currently in a consolidation phase, awaiting a breakout. Fundamentals remain positive, with CFTC-regulated futures and potential ETF catalysts. Short-term bullish but watch for corrections.
>  
> $TUT: Market cap surpassed $50M, benefiting from Binance listing vote and positioning in the AI+education sector. Potential short-term pullbacks, but long-term outlook is promising. Recommended strategy: accumulate on dips, with a 2-3x growth target.
>  
> $BANANA: Strong momentum, up 25% in 24 hours, rebounding over 120% from the bottom. High community engagement and meme culture give it strong viral potential. Binance listing vote could further boost interest, but watch out for profit-taking risks in the short term.
>  
> $MUBARAK: One of the hottest BNB Chain memecoins, gaining traction due to Binance spot listing speculation and strong community backing. Its Middle Eastern ties and global support provide a unique narrative, but market sentiment shifts could pose risks. Short-term bullish but avoid chasing highs.
>  
> $SIREN: Actively involved in the Binance listing vote, with high community engagement. Price may fluctuate based on the vote outcome. A successful listing could significantly boost liquidity and visibility, creating potential upside. Recommended: monitor voting progress and seize short-term trading opportunities.
>  
> $KOMA: Gaining attention due to the Binance listing vote, with strong community backing but some data controversies. A favorable vote outcome could drive short-term gains. Long-term sustainability depends on community activity, but market manipulation risks exist. Recommended: cautious observation until a clearer trend emerges.

> 🔥 Secondary Market Daily Report 20250319
>  
> ⭐️Market Trend
>  
> The cryptocurrency market is currently experiencing volatility and uncertainty. Major assets like Bitcoin and Ethereum have faced price declines, leading to a bearish sentiment with heightened risk aversion among investors. External factors, such as the Federal Reserve’s monetary policy decisions, continue to influence the market. Meanwhile, there is growing interest in AI-related projects and emerging ventures like Siren, indicating ongoing anticipation for technological innovation. Overall, the market appears to be cooling down, and investors should proceed with caution while awaiting clearer signals.
>  
> ⭐️Major Coins
>  
> $BTC is consolidating around $80K and may test $70K in the short term, but its long-term outlook remains bullish. Institutional buying from firms like BlackRock, along with easing geopolitical tensions and potential Fed rate cuts, provide positive catalysts. Accumulation on dips is recommended, with a target of breaking $90K.
>  
> $ETH is facing short-term selling pressure, but Justin Sun’s significant staking and whale accumulation indicate positive sentiment. The fundamentals remain strong, with Layer 2 solutions and staking yields growing steadily. The recent price dip could present an entry opportunity, though short-term volatility should be monitored. Key liquidation levels to watch: $3,194 and $1,721.
>  
> $SOL has seen transaction fees drop to record lows, benefiting network usage and ecosystem expansion. The launch of LaunchLab enhances Solana’s competitiveness, but risks such as Raydium revenue fluctuations remain. Short-term price action may be influenced by market sentiment, yet the long-term fundamentals remain solid, making dip-buying an attractive strategy.
>  
> $BNB has been performing well, driven by the Meme coin frenzy on BSC and the ongoing growth of Binance’s ecosystem. Airdrops like $BMT have increased holder incentives. Technically, $BNB faces resistance around $650 but still has upside potential in the short term. Investors should track on-chain project rotations to maximize returns.
>  
> ⭐️Trending Coins
>  
> $MUBARAK has shown strong momentum, surpassing a $200M FDV before a retracement, followed by another rally to new highs—rewarding long-term holders. With soaring popularity on BSC, MUBARAK remains the leading Meme coin, offering further upside potential. A buy-the-dip approach is recommended, with stop-loss strategies in place. In the long term, the growth of the BSC ecosystem will likely support its valuation.
>  
> $BMT recently debuted on Binance spot markets with a circulating market cap of $7.6M and an FDV of $300M. Selling pressure is relatively low, and its initial performance has been strong. With funding rates at peak levels, a short squeeze opportunity exists. Investors should monitor the upcoming launch of its detective system, which could introduce a new narrative.
>  
> $CAKE has surged 76% in the past 7 days, benefiting from the vibrant BNB Chain ecosystem and Binance’s strong backing. Its tokenomics continue to be deflationary, with accelerated token burns, reinforcing solid fundamentals. Further upside potential remains, but investors should be cautious of market volatility.
>  
> $SUI is gaining attention due to an ETF application and its collaboration with the Trump family, potentially driving institutional adoption and price appreciation. If the ETF is approved, it could attract significant capital inflows. Short-term outlook remains bullish, but investors should keep an eye on SEC approval progress. Key technical levels: support at $1.5, resistance at $2.2.
>  
> $AVAX is seeing potential upside due to ecosystem expansion in gaming and increased institutional investment. Although current prices are slightly below institutional entry points ($19.25), the continued development of Avalanche’s gaming sector could boost long-term value. In the short term, watch for $18.5 as a key support level—if it holds, an upward move is likely; otherwise, further corrections may follow.

> 🔥 Secondary Market Daily Report 20250317
>  
> ⭐️ Market Trend
>  
> The cryptocurrency market has shown some volatility recently, with overall market sentiment being cautious. Bitcoin price is approaching $85,000, with an increase in open contracts, but still affected by the Fed meeting on the 20th. ETH and SOL performance has been relatively overlooked, while BNBChain activity is high. The market anticipates the performance of ETH spot ETF and Solana futures contracts. Investor sentiment is focused on short-term opportunities, while long-term trends still need observation.
>  
> ⭐️ Major Coins
>  
> $BTC has recently shown strong resilience, maintaining above 80K despite selling pressure and negative sentiment. Recommended to buy the dip in the 73K-78K range.
>  
> $ETH currently has strong support in the $1843-1900 range and is undervalued by the market with significant potential for rebound. Despite outflows from spot ETFs, continued innovation in the Ethereum ecosystem and growing institutional interest remain promising for the long term. Consider buying on dips in the short term, with a target of breaking through $2000.
>  
> $SOL has been overlooked recently, but CME launching Solana futures contracts and Hashdex expanding its crypto index ETF to include $SOL indicate increased institutional interest. Long-term, $SOL is near key support levels, making it a good accumulation opportunity. However, caution is advised regarding short-term volatility as market sentiment remains unstable.
>  
> $BNB has shown recent strength, with an active BSC ecosystem, leading DEX trading volume, and significant TVL growth. Binance Wallet's six-month fee-free promotion is attracting users. Technically breaking through $1000 with fundamentals supporting continued upward movement. Consider buying on pullbacks, targeting new highs.
>  
> ⭐️ Trending Coins
>  
> $MUBARAK has performed strongly recently, rising after listing on Binance Futures, showing strong market confidence. Its market cap may break $500M, potentially reaching $1B. Watch for spot listing opportunities, but be cautious of short-term correction risks.
>  
> $CAKE has benefited from strong traffic from the Binance ecosystem and BSC chain activity, breaking through $2.5 with significantly increased trading volume. Binance Wallet's integration of PancakeSwap has further expanded its user base, positioning $CAKE as a core on-chain transaction token. In the bullish sentiment, $CAKE is likely to continue rising, with a short-term target of $5.
>  
> $BMT has shown strong performance, especially rising against the trend after Binance launched futures contracts, reaching new highs. As an on-chain tool on BNB Chain, it has potential as a traffic product, and market confidence increased after developers clarified token allocation concerns. It may continue to rise in the short term, but beware of high volatility risks.
>  
> $CHEEMS has performed strongly recently, becoming the leader on BNB Chain with a market cap of $270M. Despite $Mubarak's strong momentum, $CHEEMS still holds the top position. If market sentiment remains high, $CHEEMS may break through further, but be cautious of short-term correction risks.

> 🔥Secondary Market Daily Report 20250313
>  
> ⭐️Market Trend
>  
> The cryptocurrency market is currently volatile, recently experiencing a rebound due to positive political news (such as Ukraine's ceasefire and the U.S. bipartisan budget agreement) and better-than-expected economic data (CPI). However, market sentiment remains unstable; despite a slight decrease, turnover rate and VIX remain elevated. MGX's investment in Binance has boosted market confidence, but it's uncertain whether this rebound will lead to a reversal. Overall, the market is searching for a new equilibrium, and investors should remain cautious.
>  
> ⭐️Major Coins
>  
> $BTC: Recently retreated from a high of $110,000 to $80,000 amid significant volatility. Long-term fundamentals remain strong, especially given a U.S. senator’s proposal for the government to buy 200,000 bitcoins annually. The current price pullback might be a buying opportunity, but investors should stay alert to short-term sentiment fluctuations.
>  
> $ETH: Currently facing turbulent market sentiment driven by heavy leverage and significant position clashes, causing volatility. Short-term caution is advised. Long-term prospects may be negatively impacted by ongoing selling pressure from the Ethereum Foundation and bearish sentiment. However, if technical levels break key resistance, a rebound remains possible.
>  
> $SOL: Recently gained attention due to ETF applications and ecosystem developments (e.g., Jito restaking), fluctuating around $125. Although ETF approval has been delayed, market sentiment remains optimistic. Short-term correction pressures exist, but long-term ecosystem innovation and institutional interest support its potential.
>  
> $BNB: Recently surged due to MGX’s $2 billion investment and minority stake acquisition in Binance, potentially offering short-term trading opportunities. However, some investors have exited positions, reflecting divided market sentiment.
>  
> ⭐️Trending Coins
>  
> $XRP: Recently bullish due to optimism around the nearing conclusion of the SEC lawsuit and ETF applications. A settlement with the SEC would eliminate uncertainty and boost confidence. Long-term, XRP has practical applications and institutional support as an enterprise-grade blockchain solution, potentially becoming an industry standard. Investors should monitor lawsuit outcomes and ETF progress, buying dips accordingly.
>  
> $DOGE: Currently at a long-term bottom, with short-term pressure from SEC delays on ETF approvals. A breakout above $0.235 could trigger a rally. Recommended strategy: buy low and sell high while monitoring market sentiment and fundamental changes.
>  
> $GPS: Recently volatile due to a market-maker incident, but the team committed to repurchasing and burning tokens worth 4.34 million USDT, demonstrating long-term confidence. Prices remain under short-term pressure, but buybacks and compensation plans might support a bottom. A rebound is possible if market sentiment improves, suitable for gradual accumulation.
>  
> $FARTCOIN: Recently demonstrated strong meme-coin characteristics, joining $PEPE and $MOG as market highlights. On-chain data indicates increasing activity, potentially supporting further short-term upside, making it attractive for short-term traders. Investors should manage risk carefully due to high volatility.
>  
> $TAO: Showing strong recent performance, attracting over $4 million inflows in 24 hours, reflecting positive market sentiment. OpenTensor’s social media activity has increased by 70%, highlighting solid fundamentals. The long-term trend looks favorable; investors might consider accumulating during price dips.

> 🔥Secondary Market Daily Report 20250311
>  
> ⭐️Market Trend
>  
> The cryptocurrency market has recently underperformed, though stablecoin market capitalization reached a new high, indicating funds remain within the crypto ecosystem. A potential local bottom might be forming. The Ukraine ceasefire agreement could positively impact markets, yet concerns over a possible recession persist. Overall, the market remains volatile, potentially continuing to flush out short-term investors, while long-term support stays solid.
>  
> ⭐️Major Coins
>  
> $BTC has experienced significant volatility, briefly dropping below $77,000, causing panic, but the URDP gap has now been filled. A ceasefire between Russia and Ukraine might boost market sentiment. Long-term bullish opportunities exist, but investors should be cautious of short-term high leverage risks.
>  
> $ETH faces multiple pressures, including ETF outflows and bearish market sentiment, dropping below $1,800. Long-term potential remains if macroeconomic conditions stabilize.
>  
> $SOL recently rebounded to $128 but remains highly volatile. Monitoring its potential to break the $130 resistance level is key. Jump Firedancer validator's deployment could enhance network efficiency, providing long-term bullish potential. Accumulation below $200 is advised while awaiting ETF approval and improving fundamentals.
>  
> ⭐️Trending Coins
> $WHITE has recently surged, boosted by a $6 million purchase from the Trump Fund, indicating strong institutional confidence. Its underlying project, WhiteRock, connects directly with NASDAQ/NYSE, targeting banks and institutional markets with substantial potential. The current market cap stands at $400 million, with a historical peak at $1 billion, leaving considerable upside. Short-term bullish sentiment suggests monitoring entry opportunities.
>  
> $DRB shows strong performance, gaining attention as Grok's first token, integrating Base chain and AI concepts. Market sentiment remains highly optimistic, with prices hitting new highs, presenting clear short-term trading opportunities. However, caution is advised against potential pullbacks from excessive speculation. If the Grok ecosystem continues to grow, $DRB could be fundamentally supported in the long term.
>  
> $AVAX's recent ETF application announcement significantly validates its undervalued potential. Although current prices have declined, an ETF could accelerate listings on major exchanges and staking features. Coupled with active DeFi ecosystem involvement, $AVAX maintains a bullish long-term outlook, with buying opportunities following pullbacks.
>  
> $TRX has bucked market trends recently, being the only profitable token within WLFI's holdings, demonstrating strong resilience and market acceptance. Given its stable performance and ability to outperform most major coins, short-term pullback buying opportunities are advisable. Continued development within the TRON ecosystem provides fundamental support.
>  
> $MOVE has attracted attention due to its mainnet launch and ETF application, with potential further upside if it surpasses $0.55. Backed by strong fundamentals, solid team funding, and institutional support, the short-term outlook remains bullish, yet investors should stay cautious of market volatility and speculative risks.

> 🔥 Secondary Market Daily Report 20250311
>  
> Market Trend
>  
> The overall cryptocurrency market is in a state of extreme panic. Bitcoin has fallen below its 200-day moving average, and the market’s total capitalization has dropped more than 30% from its December high. Major cryptocurrencies like ETH and SOL have seen significant declines, and the DeFi TVL has given back all the gains since Trump's election. Analysts believe that the current consolidation period may evolve into a mid-term bear market. Although Bitcoin might become a safe-haven asset in the future, it is still considered high-risk at present. Market sentiment is nearing a collapse threshold, with Bitcoin's short-term support level around $70,000.
>  
> Major Coins
>  
> $BTC: Recently facing dual pressures from ETF capital outflows and bearish chart patterns. It may continue to correct in the short term, but buying opportunities are emerging on dips. Key support levels need to be closely monitored.
>  
> $ETH: Recently fell below $2,000, but whales bought 330K $ETH within 48 hours, indicating a potential bottom-fishing opportunity. It is recommended to watch for a rebound to $2,140.
>  
> $SOL: From a technical perspective, if it falls below the key support at $90, it could decline further.
>  
> Trending Coins
>  
> $WHITE: Recently attracted institutional inflows due to WhiteRock’s connection with NASDAQ/NYSE and the provision of T+0 settlement, combined with a $6 million investment from the Trump fund. It is bullish in the short term. However, market volatility remains a concern, and its long-term potential depends on adoption by banks and institutions.
>  
> $DRB: As Grok’s first token, it shows strong growth potential supported by the Base chain and a robust ecosystem. Grok has generated continuous revenue through trading fees, accumulating $165K, which demonstrates high market activity. If it gets listed on a CEX in the short term, the price could be further boosted. Short-term trading opportunities are present, but caution is needed due to volatility risks.
>  
> $MOVE: With its mainnet launch and ETF application submission, it marks a new phase for the project. Recent institutional actions have been frequent, and ETF expectations have increased, potentially driving short-term price gains. However, market volatility, especially regarding the uncertainty of the ETF approval outcome, should be monitored. In the long term, $MOVE has strong fundamentals and is worth attention.
>  
> $RARE: Recently performed strongly with a gain of over 60%. Spot prices have broken through resistance levels, and there is still room in the futures market. Although the decline in $ETH has affected the art prices, $RARE's fundamentals remain solid. Being in a relatively bottomed cycle in the long term, it may continue to rise after the adjustment. Watch for a breakout after the consolidation.
>  
> $ENA: Has performed strongly amid the bear market, with technical analysis showing a bullish expanding wedge pattern and a short-term support level around 0.406. Despite facing token unlocking pressure, its fundamentals are good, with stable TVL and revenue. It is recommended to monitor the resistance level at 0.483; a breakout above this level could lead to further gains. Short-term traders might consider taking profits, while long-term investors should be cautious when entering.

> 🔥 Secondary Market Daily Report 20250308
>  
> ⭐️Market Trend
> The cryptocurrency market is currently facing a significant pullback, with Bitcoin falling below $80,000 and a total of $284 million in liquidated contracts across the network, primarily due to long liquidations. The market is under pressure from macroeconomic factors, policy uncertainties, and global trade issues. In the short term, investors should operate with caution, avoiding blind bottom-fishing or short selling, and prioritize avoiding liquidation.
>  
> ⭐️Major Coins
> $BTC: Bitcoin is currently testing a critical support level at $80,000; a breach could trigger large-scale long liquidations. In the short term, a downtrend towards $74,000 and $71,000 is possible, though it retains long-term potential as institutions in the US and elsewhere continue to accumulate. Caution is advised—avoid blindly bottom-fishing or shorting, and keep an eye on further macroeconomic impacts on the market.
>  
> $ETH: Ethereum is hovering around $2,000, showing clear support pressure. Despite the prevailing market pessimism, whales are buying the dip, suggesting potential for a rebound. A break below $2,000 could see ETH dropping to $1,550. In the long term, ETH's fundamentals remain strong, especially with US banks participating as validators in ETH staking, providing new growth momentum. It is recommended to closely monitor key support levels and consider accumulating on dips.
>  
> $SOL: Solana is currently experiencing a significant pullback, but the passing of the SIMD-0228 proposal, which could reduce inflation by 80%, is beneficial for its long-term value. In the short term, it may test support around $110, though long-term holders remain optimistic about its fundamentals. Attention should be paid to the March 11 ETF approval result, which could bring short-term rebound opportunities.
>  
> ⭐️Trending Coins
> $MOVE: Recently, $MOVE has shown strong performance. With the mainnet scheduled to launch on March 10, along with advantages such as 100k TPS and ETH compatibility, it has attracted institutional funds. The price rebounded 40% from a low of $0.37 to trade at $0.52, approaching resistance at $0.59–$0.60. A breakout could pave the way for further gains.
>  
> $SUI: $SUI has also demonstrated strong recent performance, with its TVL growing by 107% and a collaboration with the Trump family’s WLFI project, strengthening its fundamentals. Despite short-term price fluctuations, the long-term trend remains optimistic. Currently, the price is oscillating between $2.49 and $3; a move above $3 could signal further upside. It is advised to watch the key support at $2.67; a drop below this level warrants caution.
>  
> $XRP: XRP has seen a surge in trading volume recently, with 24-hour transfers reaching $5 billion, indicating heightened market activity. Coupled with its fundamentals, the US government's cryptocurrency reserve plan might further boost its value. In the short term, buying on dips could be a good opportunity, but investors should be mindful of overall market pullback risks.
>  
> $DRB: As the first AI project deployed by Grok, $DRB has seen significant gains recently, with a current market cap of $5.7M. By combining the AI and MEME sectors and being issued on the Base chain alongside @bankrbot, it has a unique hot-topic attribute. While there are short-term trading opportunities, caution is advised due to potential market volatility.

> Investing in meme coins isn’t just a roll of the dice—it’s a disciplined blend of narrative insight, data-driven analysis, rigorous risk management, and agile market response. Master these strategies to thrive in this high-risk, high-reward arena.

> 6. Focus, Concentrated Investments & Continuous Improvement
>  
> Not every meme coin is a winner. Instead of spreading thin, concentrate on a few thoroughly vetted projects with high potential. Combine this focus with regular review and analysis of your decisions and market trends. Learn from every trade to continually refine your strategy.

> 5. Flexible Response to Market Sentiment
>  
> Meme coin markets are notoriously volatile. Don’t blindly buy the dip after a loss, nor let greed make you miss profit-taking. Develop dynamic stop-loss and take-profit strategies that let you adjust positions rapidly when unexpected events occur.

> 3. Accurate Risk-Reward Assessment
>  
> Set clear target market caps and valuation ranges before investing. Whether it's a 1B or 100B cap narrative, evaluate the potential from the current market cap. Use a phased profit-taking strategy: secure your principal early, then realize gains gradually to maintain a solid risk-reward balance. Avoid putting all your funds into one coin.

> 2. In-Depth Analysis of Token Distribution
>  
> Understanding a coin’s circulating supply and whale action is the foundation for success. Track top 100 addresses, trading volume relative to market cap, and signs of accumulation. Spotting “smart money” moves helps you time entries and exits.

> 1. Hot Narrative is King
>  
> Choosing a narrative that resonates and goes viral is crucial. A meme's success hinges not only on creativity but also on its ability to evoke public emotion. Focus on trending topics in tech, culture, politics, etc. to spark market excitement.
