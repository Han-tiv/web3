If the powers that be that have monopolies on hypnosis, mind control, mesmerization, could move people towards being their best: loving, helping, winning, achieving, being strong, having family, etc. the world would look unimaginably different. If the global lens was focused on positive.\n\nPeople don't realize that was one of the main goals of \"religion,\" and let's not even call it that, let's call it \"Project God.\" \"Project God,\" was \"Let's unite people around this one common impossible to reach standard, that's not tied to any one person, that can't be corrupted because it's not a real person, and let people strive to reach it.\" That's what created some of the best works of art, education, sanitation, societal advancement , everything we've seen. REAL progress. \n\nBut today, like what happens with most things, that power is corrupted and used for bullshit, to sow division, clicks, engagement, ragebait, whatever, and invert good for nonsense. \n\nIt would be incredible to see what humanity could do if we were all focused on one single point of focus. And have that point of focus be positive attributed that lead to GROWTH rather than decay: victory, achievement, valor, love, respect, glory, etc.\n\nAll the words that have been \"inverted\" to be \"scary and mean,\" by people who do not know the first thing about building anything real in the world, let alone anything that endures and sustains.\n\nTLDR: Focus is incredible. The more people who focus on one point, the more powerful the collective focus of everyone becomes. Imagine if the entire world focused on positive growth points of focus. What would humanity become?",

If there was none, he knew he could talk business. \n\nThen for the final test he’d drop a n-bomb. This was the real sink or swim moment.

It's gone now. It was beneficial.\n- A \"satire\" button for posts to avoid unnecessary community notes and allow people to make more clever and riskier posts while still communicating its satire to avoid confusion. A small box could appear next to the post sort of like the subscribers posts.\n- An AI button for the same above reason.\n- A “I’m sorry” button for when you’re blocked that can send the user who blocked you a single ping as a way to request an unblock. \n\nHopefully this more or less covers the major quality of use changes that could be made.\n\nIf there’s anything else you’d like to see you can mention it here.",
