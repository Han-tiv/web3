> Imagine what the world would look like if the power of psyop was used for good. If the powers that be that have monopolies on hypnosis, mind control, mesmerization, could move people towards being their best: loving, helping, winning, achieving, being strong, having family, etc. the world would look unimaginably different. If the global lens was focused on positive.
>  
> People don't realize that was one of the main goals of "religion," and let's not even call it that, let's call it "Project God." "Project God," was "Let's unite people around this one common impossible to reach standard, that's not tied to any one person, that can't be corrupted because it's not a real person, and let people strive to reach it." That's what created some of the best works of art, education, sanitation, societal advancement , everything we've seen. REAL progress.
>  
> But today, like what happens with most things, that power is corrupted and used for bullshit, to sow division, clicks, engagement, ragebait, whatever, and invert good for nonsense.
>  
> It would be incredible to see what humanity could do if we were all focused on one single point of focus. And have that point of focus be positive attributed that lead to GROWTH rather than decay: victory, achievement, valor, love, respect, glory, etc.
>  
> All the words that have been "inverted" to be "scary and mean," by people who do not know the first thing about building anything real in the world, let alone anything that endures and sustains.
>  
> TLDR: Focus is incredible. The more people who focus on one point, the more powerful the collective focus of everyone becomes. Imagine if the entire world focused on positive growth points of focus. What would humanity become?

>  
> - The sorting by "top" for quote retweets doesn't work
> - The sorting by "top" for likes doesn't remain at the latest setting. It always defaults back to recent. Would be nice to have it stay as top
> - Scheduled posts on mobile
> - The ability to edit replies to a post (within the time window)
> - The ability to edit your original post after you've already replied to it with a follow up post (provided you're within the window)
> - Disallow people from adding you to random groups in DMs
> - Prevent random phantom messages spam (A notification that you have unread messages but there are none)
> - The ability to have both polls/pictures in the same post
> - A default “show poll results” option
> - There used to be an "add post" button on threads with two or more posts to easily create a thread. It's gone now. It was beneficial.
> - A "satire" button for posts to avoid unnecessary community notes and allow people to make more clever and riskier posts while still communicating its satire to avoid confusion. A small box could appear next to the post sort of like the subscribers posts.
> - An AI button for the same above reason.
> - A “I’m sorry” button for when you’re blocked that can send the user who blocked you a single ping as a way to request an unblock.
>  
> Hopefully this more or less covers the major quality of use changes that could be made.
>  
> If there’s anything else you’d like to see you can mention it here.

People will often associate our posts of memes with the coins they’re trying to shill because that’s the crypto game, but we’re not KOLs or involved. No matter what we post, people will try to associate a coin with it to promote their own bags, so if you see something claiming association, it’s a lie and/or scam. Don’t get duped.
