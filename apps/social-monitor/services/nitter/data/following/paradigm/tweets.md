> We are thrilled to announce that Agora has raised a $50 million Series A round, led by @paradigm and with additional participation from @dragonfly_xyz. This milestone enables us to accelerate the development of Agora’s full-stack platform for stablecoin infrastructure, purpose-built to support the next generation of digital finance applications.
>  
> At Agora, our mission is to transform how money moves. We believe stablecoins will underpin a new financial fabric, one that is faster, more global, and more efficient than today’s siloed systems. That is why we are building AUSD and the Agora stack, a full service platform that makes issuing, managing, and integrating stablecoins seamless – whether you’re a developer, fintech, or institution. With AUSD, stablecoins become programmable, composable, and ubiquitous by default.
>  
> Over the past year, we’ve shipped the foundational elements for AUSD, including:
> - Deep and robust onchain liquidity across 13 networks
> - Native deployments across @arbitrum, @avax, @BNBCHAIN, @Coredao_Org, @ethereum, @Immutable, @injective, @katana, @Mantle_Official, @0xPolygon, @solana, and @SuiNetwork.
> - Comprehensive integrations with exchanges and onramps
> - Secure, scalable minting and redemption flows.
> - Tens of billions in cumulative volume
> - 50,000+ monthly active addresses
>  
> Dozens of customers like @nonco_otc, @flowdesk_co, @vaneck_us, @conduitxyz, @katana, @fslweb3,  @plumenetwork already rely on Agora to power their stablecoin flows and infrastructure.
>  
> Announcing White-Labeled Stablecoins for All
> Alongside our new partnership with Paradigm, we are entering the next chapter of Agora: deepening our connective tissue between both the onchain and fiat infrastructure layers.
>  
> Today, we are excited to formally announce the launch of our white-labeled stablecoin product – a turnkey solution that enables enterprises and teams to instantly issue their own branded stablecoin in days, not months. No need to manage complex infrastructure, secure banking relationships, liquidity, or build from scratch – Agora handles it all. We were long believers that to truly build a platform you needed to start with building the network.
>  
> Out of the box, partners get:
> - Institutional-grade custodians and asset management
> - Deep onchain liquidity
> - A robust stablecoin dashboard, analytics, and control
> - Forward thinking compliance architecture
> - CEX and DEX integrations
> - Local FX on and off ramps
> - Zero fees when minting with USDC/T
> - You control the rewards
>  
> Agora’s white-label product empowers businesses to rapidly innovate, bypass traditional product constraints, and deliver customized financial services to their users efficiently and transparently. This significant step not only demonstrates Agora’s ongoing commitment to pioneering programmable digital finance but also positions us at the heart of the future digital economy.
>  
> Learn more here: agora.finance/product/white-….
>  
> Why Now
> Stablecoins are no longer niche. They’ve become a foundational primitive for the future of finance and capital markets. But most companies still struggle to adopt them due to regulatory hurdles, technical gaps, and fragmented liquidity.
>  
> Agora exists to change that.
>  
> With the addition of Paradigm and Dragonfly’s continued support, Agora is building the infrastructure layer that abstracts away the complexity. We aim to foster an ecosystem where creating, managing, and integrating stablecoins becomes seamless so that every fintech, exchange, and enterprise can benefit from having its own stablecoin whether it be AUSD or newUSD – as a product feature, revenue growth lever, and strategic differentiator.

> Matt Huang is a rare investor.
>  
> In his early twenties, on a week-long vacation to China, he met with Zhang Yiming. Yiming was building a personalized news app out of a dusty apartment in Beijing. Huang didn’t like the idea, and couldn’t understand a word Yiming said, but he could tell Yiming was special.
>  
> He found a way to invest at a ~$20 million valuation. Yiming’s app turned into TikTok and Huang’s share of the business, ByteDance, has turned into a sum approaching one billion dollars.
>  
> At Sequoia, he refined that talent for seeing genius early and developed a stellar reputation. When he left in 2018, Michael Moritz reportedly called him "the only regrettable loss in Sequoia's history."
>  
> Later that year, he co-founded a crypto investing business with @FEhrsam, who had previously co-founded Coinbase. They called it @paradigm, and today the firm manages over $12 billion.
>  
> Huang is rare, not because of his success or his ability to spot category-defining companies in their infancy, but because he has built an investing firm where the mission genuinely comes before the money.
>  
> As @brian_armstrong, CEO and Co-founder of Coinbase, said: “Who leaves a job like that at Sequoia? He’s a silent killer. Our industry needs more people like him who have high integrity and are in it for the long-term and the right reasons.”
>  
> Paradigm doesn’t just invest, it builds. Its researchers, who double as investors, develop foundational innovations, then give them away to the entire industry. Their open-source tools power 90% of smart contract development. Their mathematical breakthroughs have helped create billion-dollar companies.
>  
> The mission is to advance the frontier of crypto. Returns follow the mission. Six years in, it is working. Paradigm’s flagship fund has grown from $760 million to $8.3 billion.
>  
> Behind the numbers is an unconventional team, which Huang likens to the X-Men Academy.
>  
> “No one is central casting to be hired by another investing firm,” he said. But folks like @_charlienoyes, @danrobinson, and @gakonst do things that no other investors can, and Huang, along with @alanapalmedo, hold their quirks together like few leaders can.
>  
> I spent the past couple of months learning everything I could about Huang and Paradigm. At first, I was drawn to his remarkable achievements but as I spent more time with him, his Paradigm team, and people close to him, it became clear that the real story was in their steadfast mission to make crypto successful.
>  
> @matthuang might be the most important investor you've never heard of. You can learn all about him in my profile linked below.
>  
> In an industry known for short-term thinking, he's playing a game measured in decades, with a team that’s quietly reshaping finance from their penthouse office overlooking San Francisco.

> 🚨 Action required: After >3yrs of heads-down development, Foundry is en route to our first stable release! Upgrade your installation of Foundryup! 🚨
>  
> 2025 is looking to be an amazing year with faster and more secure EVM smart contracts!
>  
> Foundry is a critical part of the EVM development stack, empowering developers through their end to end development lifecycle, from quick builds to deep tests and rich debugging workflows.
>  
> More importantly, for the EVM to win, Foundry must remain a reliable building block for developers. For that, we must graduate to having stable releases, so we encourage all developers to upgrade their `foundryup` installations.
>  
> Upgrading is really simple, just run: `curl -L foundry.paradigm.xyz | bash`.
>  
> ❗Why upgrade?
>  
> Upgrading ensures your `foundryup` defaults to updating to the latest stable release instead of the latest nightly build. That build is hosted on Github under the `stable` tag: github.com/foundry-rs/foundr….
>  
> In the coming weeks, we'll be shipping our last few breaking changes to Foundry (e.g., turning off the optimizer by default, which was recently shipped). If you do not upgrade, you will continue to receive nightly builds by default, which may contain these breaking changes.
>  
> ✨ Prefer nightly builds?
>  
> You are still able to receive the latest nightly builds by running `foundryup --install nightly`
>  
> Be cautious — nightly builds may include breaking changes that are difficult to debug without context.

> *The Casino on Mars*
>  
> It’s useful to think of crypto as a new planet that’s being settled.
>  
> Skeptics see a desolate planet without purpose. Or worse, a haven for an unsavory casino.
>  
> Optimists see the planet’s potential: a blank slate on which we can build an upgraded financial system and internet platform.
>  
> Early settlers are a mixed bunch. Explorers drawn to the frontier. Speculators, some rough and disreputable. Innovators and researchers, attracted to what’s newly possible. Ordinary people, especially those marginalized on Earth.
>  
> Governance remains ambiguous. Some Earthly jurisdictions prohibit their citizens from visiting. Others seek a foothold in the new world.
>  
> A history of speculation and hype cycles has cast a social taboo over the new planet, leaving many to wonder: what is its future?
>  
> Today’s casino-like speculation is part of a bootstrapping process. Much like the gold rush of 1849 transformed San Francisco from a quaint village into a major port (and ultimately the heart of tech innovation), today’s speculative frenzy in crypto is attracting the settlers and catalyzing the infrastructure necessary to turn a barren planet into a thriving crypto civilization.

> Paradigm has never been more dedicated to crypto.
>  
> When Fred and I started Paradigm five years ago, there was no master plan. What we had was a shared curiosity for the future, deep conviction in crypto, and a desire to advance the frontier of what’s possible.
>  
> Our best decision early on was creating the role of “research partner.”
>  
> It wasn’t a role that existed (as far as we knew)—we invented it to convince @danrobinson to join.
>  
> We didn’t even know exactly what he’d work on—we just knew he belonged on the team.
>  
> Dan, along with @_charlienoyes, helped set the foundation for Paradigm’s deeply technical, research-driven approach. Our team today is an extension of that brilliant and quirky foundation.
>  
> Five years in, we’re still learning from the research-driven approach that we stumbled onto.
>  
> Investing has made us better researchers, and research has made us better investors.
>  
> We hire deeply curious people and push them to follow their instincts.
>  
> What started as an experiment in 2019 has become core to who we are — “research-driven” — a change that is now reflected on our website.
>  
> We’ve never been more excited about crypto and we continue to invest across all stages, publish original research, help portfolio companies develop mechanisms (like Uniswap v2, v3, v4), ship open source projects (Foundry, Reth), advocate for good policy, and more.
>  
> We’re also a group of curious nerds and the developments in AI are too interesting to ignore.
>  
> It seems trendy to frame crypto vs AI as a zero-sum competition. But we don’t buy it.
>  
> Both are interesting and will have plenty of overlap. We’re excited to continue exploring.
