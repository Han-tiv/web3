However, several additional suspicious transactions occurred hours later, likely exploiting the same underlying issue through slightly varied attack paths.   \n\nIn general, the attacker first created a margin account, then borrowed additional assets through leveraged lending using the provided collateral, and finally executed a sandwich attack targeting the swap operation involving the borrowed assets.  \n\nThe root cause appears to be a flawed insolvency check in the MarginTrading contract's swap() function, which exchanges borrowed assets from one token (e.g., WBTC) to another (e.g., USDC). The function only verifies solvency based on the account state at the beginning of the swap, before the asset exchange is executed, leaving room for manipulation during the process.  \n\nAttacker 1 (0xd356c82e0c85e1568641d084dbdaf76b8df96c08) carried out multiple attacks, earning ~$61K in profit. \n- Attacker1's TX1 (create margin account): app.blocksec.com/explorer/tx…\n- Attacker1's TX2 (launch attack): app.blocksec.com/explorer/tx… \n\nAttacker 2 (0xaa24987bab540617416b77c986f66ae009c55795) executed a single attack, earning ~$85K in profit. \n- Attacker2's TX1 (create margin account): app.blocksec.com/explorer/tx…\n- Attacker2's TX2 (launch attack): app.blocksec.com/explorer/tx…",

The root cause stems from the flawed implementation logic of the cook function, which allows users to execute multiple predefined operations in a single transaction. Specifically, the actions share a common status, which may lead to the bypassing of the insolvency check.\n\nThe details are as follows:\n1. When action = 5 (ACTION_BORROW), a borrowing operation is executed, and status.needsSolvencyCheck is set to true.\n2. When action = 0, the internal function _additionalCookAction is called to update the status. However, this function is an empty function and defaults to returning status.needsSolvencyCheck = false, thereby overwriting the previous check flag and skipping the final insolvency check.\n\nThe attacker called the cook function on 6 different addresses, passing in actions = [5, 0], obtained 1,793,755e18 MIM, and subsequently profited through swaps.\n\nAttack TX: app.blocksec.com/explorer/tx…",

Several hours ago, our system detected an attack transaction targeting the NGP token (issued by @newgoldprotocol) on #BSC, resulting in ~$2M in losses.\n\nThis incident is a price manipulation attack, rooted in two critical design flaws of the NGP token:\n1) The token’s buying amount limit can be bypassed by setting the recipient address of token transfers to the \"DEAD\" address;\n2) When selling NGP tokens, the contract syncs to reflect fee deductions—a process that can be abused to manipulate the token’s price.\n\nHere’s a breakdown of how the attack unfolded:\n1. The attacker purchased NGP Token at a normally low price using multiple accounts.\n2. They then inflated NGP’s price by executing large-volume BUSD-for-NGP swaps on the BUSD-NGP PancakePair. Crucially, by setting the recipient address to the \"DEAD\" address, the attacker bypassed two key restrictions during acquisition: the \"maxBuyAmountInUsdt\" limit and the buyer’s cooldown limit.\n3. Finally, the attacker drained BUSD from the pool using the NGP Token purchased earlier. While certain fees were deducted (e.g., fees allocated to the treasury and reward pools), this action left the pool’s NGP reserves extremely depleted. This depletion, in turn, triggered a sharp surge in the token’s price—completing the manipulation.\n\nAttack TX: app.blocksec.com/explorer/tx…",

When users stake or lock BURN via a referrer, the contract credits them with referral rewards in BUSD. These rewards are calculated based on the volume of BURN staked/locked and the real-time BURN/BUSD spot price.\n2. The attacker exploited this flaw by manipulating BURN’s price via flash loans. They then repeatedly created new contracts to bypass two critical restrictions—the \"one referral per address\" rule and maximum investment limits—allowing them to accumulate artificially inflated BUSD rewards.\n3. Afterward, the attacker sold off the remaining borrowed BURN to repurchase BUSD—a move that drove down BURN’s price.

Our system has detected a series of malicious transactions targeting an unverified contract (0x16d7c6f43df19778e382b7a84bcb8c763971a551) on the Binance Smart Chain (BSC), with losses exceeding $600K. Since the contract is not open-source, our investigation indicates the root cause lies in a lack of slippage protection. This vulnerability allowed attackers to exploit the contract by using a fake liquidity pool to harvest #TA tokens (0x539ae81a166e5e80aed211731563e549c411b140), which were then sold in the legitimate pool to make profits.\n\nUsers who have granted approvals to this contract (0x16d7c6f43df19778e382b7a84bcb8c763971a551) are strongly advised to revoke those permissions immediately to prevent further losses!!!\n\nAttack TXs:\napp.blocksec.com/explorer/tx…\napp.blocksec.com/explorer/tx…\napp.blocksec.com/explorer/tx…",

Specifically, key parameters of the liquidateWithSingleRepay function in the NFTLiquidation contract were controllable by the attacker, allowing manipulation of the extraRepayAmount variable through the repayAmount parameter. By exploiting this, the attacker was able to liquidate all collateral with just one token.\n\nThe key attack steps are summarized as follows:\n1. The attacker first deposited oETH and borrowed various assets to reach the liquidation threshold. Simultaneously, they created a new contract that, through a donation attack and precision loss (inherent from the Compound V2 fork), reduced the oETH exchange rate, making the attacker's position eligible for liquidation.\n2. The attacker then performed the liquidation. Due to insufficient parameter validation, the attacker manipulated the extraRepayAmount variable, which was added to the calculation of how many tokens needed to be liquidated. This allowed the attacker to obtain more oETH through liquidation, leading to a profit.\n\nAttack Tx: app.blocksec.com/explorer/tx…",
