      "content": "The @ArcadiaFi hack resulted in over $2M in losses due to a long chain of an arbitrary call. \n\nThe attacker exploited the rebalancing process by crafting arbitrary swap data for rebalancing. This allowed the rebalancer to make calls to any account, which could then re-enter the rebalancer and trigger further full arbitrary calls to victim accounts. This call chain lets the attacker withdraw more assets while repaying less.\n\nSpecifically, `Rebalancer.executeAction` is only callable by an Account, and `Account.flashAction` is only callable by the Rebalancer. By chaining `Rebalancer.rebalance(controlled_data)` → `Account1.flashAction(partially controlled_data)` → `Rebalancer.executeAction(controlled_data)` → `Account2.flashAction(full controlled_data)`, the attacker was able to pass arbitrary calldata to `Account2.flashAction`.\n\n`flashAction` accepts an array of debt and underlying assets, which are meant to be controlled by the rebalancer. Once the attacker gained control over the calldata, they could specify fewer debt assets while withdrawing all assets from the account—repaying only one debt but taking the full balance.\n\napp.blocksec.com/explorer/tx…",

The sequencer provides a Geyser / Yellowstone endpoint that streams processed transactions out. Verifiers of our chain operate on shreds (sets of transactions), instead of blocks. So the block, in terms of our chain, is purely a measure for chaining the blockchain. \n\nBeyond compatibility with Solana, another reason we don't build a <400ms block is due to pre-execution. If block time is short, one can DoS the chain by sending transactions depending on block time, making all pre-executions for those transactions invalid under congestion (tx takes longer time to be consumed by the sequencer).",

The vulnerability is simple, but this might be the first 0day found then exploited by an AI agent. \n\nThe vulnerability was reported 4 months ago but was never fixed, so here is the disclosure of the vulnerability and how the agent found it: \n\nRisingWave & some databases based on Arrow allow every user, including read-only users, to create UDFs. The UDFs are then passed to `arrow-udf` package (used by Arrow) for execution. The package creates a sandbox via sub-interpreters for Python code to execute, with flags like allow_exec=0 and allow_threads=0 (github.com/arrow-udf/arrow-u…) to disallow imports and `os` package. \n\nHowever, Python’s sub-interpreters are not designed as true sandboxes; even with these flags, the object hierarchy remains accessible. By leveraging Python’s introspection features, we can enumerate every subclass of objects and inspect each subclass’s __globals__ dictionary, thereby finding the `sys` module. Once sys is found, it can be used to retrieve `os` from `sys.modules`, circumventing any restrictions the sandbox might impose. \n\nDuring pentesting, our agent found a hardcoded Risingwave credential leaked in the frontend, and then connected to the database. The credential has read-only privilege and can only view limited tables with no valuable information. The agent then searched the RisingWave document and found the UDF feature. Initially, it searched and tried to use common sandbox escape code inside UDF, but none worked. Then, it used these code as seeds and started mutating (fuzzing). Finally, it gets access to `os` package. Exploiting this RCE, the pentest agent gained full control over target GCP+AWS via information in the database and metadata endpoint. All of these steps were conducted in ~36 hours with some human interventions.",

We used the same concept as Solana, with little modification.\n\nWe use a sharded turbine architecture combined with PCDN. Each shred is pushed to one of the shards managed by the current leader. These shreds are then compressed and broadcast via dark fibers to underlying replicas managed by the current leader in multiple regions.\n\nMultiple layers of replicas can exist, as in Solana. Finally, the shred gets to the verifiers. Note that at this stage, the bandwidth now is significantly (^n) higher than just that of the current leader itself. Hundreds of verifiers then serve state sync requests from normal users.\n\nBandwidth is very expensive. We leverage PCDN to reduce costs for state subscribers who do not want low latency (do not stake). State syncs and historical states are served via random folks interested in contributing storage and bandwidth, and the subscribers can fetch asynchronously in parallel.",

The vulnerability allows hackers to steal all trading fees and modify metadata (e.g. change \"toly's minute\" to \"vitalik's minute\") of every tokens launched. \n\nAs the issue has been resolved, here is the full disclosure:\n\ntime.fun provides each new user with a dedicated wallet to deposit USDC for trading. User's private key is securely stored in a third party provider. But SOL is needed to cover gas fees and time.fun wants a seamless interaction for users, the wallet “HW2C...Lo1H” signs every trade transaction alongside the user’s wallet signature. Surprisingly, this same wallet also owns all tokens launched by time.fun. As it is one of the signers, we can act on behalf of “HW2C...Lo1H” if we can let the backend sign arbitrary data.\n\nWe discovered that by forging a token, it was possible to trick the backend into believing it was signing a legitimate transaction—letting us change metadata or withdraw all funds from “HW2C...Lo1H.” We reached out to the team (through buying 1 minute of their founder on time.fun) meanwhile did a whitehat hack. The team responded and fixed quickly and we returned all the funds.\n\nAll backends should never sign transactions coming from the frontend, regardless of how thorough the validation or simulation checks appear.

If this tx is not sent to the private RPC, then it can lead to a $200+ profit for the sandwich bot, and the sandwich bot must sandwich it. However, none did and the block builder payment was much lower than $200 at that block, so it is apparent that CZ used private RPC. \n\nThe reason that CZ's buy tx failed was due to someone buying TST ahead of CZ (bscscan.com/tx/0x9b2b3b99536…). Unfortunately, this guy got sandwiched. Block builder prioritized this tx with sandwich txs over CZ's tx because the sandwich bot made $0.2 payments to block builder. If CZ set his gas price to 1.5gwei, his tx would likely be prioritized and succeed. \n\nThe real suspicious thing is why would 0xB2d57876271eA8684e7c521c1265b87703d9A0DA (B1) know CZ is buying $TST in advance. The bot explicitly checked CZ's TST balance (if it succeeds) and attempted to backrun his transaction. Is the private orderflow shared with this bot? Maybe I am retarded and missed something, or I guess only the bot owner/block builder/relay knows.",

Without hesitation, we @verilog_audit invested in Fuzzland, joining their team in pushing the boundaries of security innovation.  \n\nCongratulations to Chaofan and the @fuzzland_  team on completing the merge deal! Wishing you all the best in your collaboration with @solayer_labs, and I’m looking forward to seeing how this partnership brings us an even better user experience! \n\nFor me, the true meaning of investing isn’t about returns or valuations—it’s about the opportunity to walk alongside founders who are full of energy, capability, and vision.

I thought you guys are restaking projects\" Lots of friends ask me this question when I share the paper around.\n\nThe answer is, restaking is NEVER our mission. We were,  are, and always target to make blockchain the next generation of internet: Unlimited, Fast, Cheap, and Accessible.\n\nWe started from @solana  as SVM has the best parallelization capability and adoption.  \n\nThen we started from restaking (EndoAVS: solayer.org/platform/endoavs) as as we find out that stake-weighted quality of service can HELP prioritize tx. Its also a good starting point to solve the congestion issues of solana and also for us to build up the team and influence.\n\nWe also researched many solutions as well, projects like @jito_sol, @bloxroute have their good ways to tackle the solana congestion issue.\n\nBut we believe the end game is not further software optimization or competing for block space by paying more. Blockchain should be a public infra like internet: \"Unlimited, Fast, Cheap, and Accessible\".\n\n@jump_firedancer  reminds us of early @Cisco and we believe that believe that hardware gona be the admission ticket to the end game.\n\nSo, here we go:\n\n- World first hardware accelerated chain\n- 100+ GBPS network bandwidth\n- 1M+ TPS\n\nTestnet soon",

Line rate (100Gbps~4Tbps or 16B+ TPS) transaction ingestion and processing have been achieved internally.   \n\nEveryone can play Minecraft, stream 8K videos, and trade at lightspeed fully on Solayer chain. To achieve this, we draw inspiration from @jump_firedancer and offload almost every component of Solana to hardware like SmartNIC and programmable switches.   \n\nAll transactions sent to Solayer Chain will first hit the scalable ingress clusters consisting of hundreds to millions of nodes for scrubbing and pre-executions based on probabilistic predictions of future states. All execution snapshots are sent to a sequencer built using Intel Tofino switches and additional FPGA to decide an optimal schedule - most transactions do not require execution at the sequencer. For the remaining conflicting transactions, our sequencer leverages the SOTA scheduling algorithm based on more fine-grained account access patterns collected from pre-execution to re-execute.   \n\nFor a simple workload, we can achieve over 16B+ TPS, and for a fully conflicting workload, we can achieve over 890K TPS. In another way of saying, for each second, we can process billions of people transferring USDC and millions of people aping the same memecoin on Raydium.   \n\nTestnet soon.",
