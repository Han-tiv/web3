Users lost up to –$39 000 on hedged trades.\n→ Possible SEC Rule 10b-5 / CEA 6(c)(1) violations.\n2.ADL & Risk-Control Failures\nADL closed only derivative legs, leaving spot exposure. “Safe hedge” marketing misled users; insurance funds not applied.\n→ Misrepresentation / fraudulent inducement.\n3.Liquidity Shortfalls & Artificial Wicks\nEmpty order books on BTC/SOL pairs; no market-maker backup or circuit-breaker.\n→ Potential CEA 9(a) artificial-price creation.\n4.Refusal to Compensate & Opaque Fees\nSupport tickets closed; “KFC promotion” mocked users. Liquidation fees raised 0.5%→1% without notice or refund.\n→ Violates CFTC Reg. 1.55 / 17 CFR 166.3 (transparency & fair dealing).\n\n⸻\n\nEvidence (available on request)\n•Public threads by @river_bluffer show price gaps and user losses.\n•Screenshots: liquidation times, margin ratios, TX hashes, support IDs.\n•Archived ToS (Oct 2025) lacks multi-venue index or circuit breaker clauses.\n•@Backpack posts advertising EU/US availability contradict jurisdiction claims.\n\n⸻\n\nRequested Actions\n1.Investigate pricing, liquidation, and risk systems of @Backpack.\n2.Assess offering of unregistered derivatives to US/EU/SG users.\n3.Order restitution and publish investor alerts if violations confirmed.\n4.Coordinate cross-border enforcement among @MAS_sg and @ESMAComms.\n\n⸻\n\nReporter Details\n\nJoe shao  |  United States  |  Email jwfv4n@163.com\nWilling to submit complete records and sworn statement upon request.\n\nSincerely,\nJoe shao\nOctober 19, 2025",

Open：模型可下载、可运行\n2. Monetizable：使用情况可验证、可追踪\n3. Loyal：v1 还有限制，但未来版本会更好地 enforce 使用规则\n\n追踪可以通过 TEE 或 AI 原生加密证明来实现；Fingerprinting 技术保证即便模型开源，贡献者的归属也不会被遗忘。\n\n这意味着：即使模型已经共享给世界，它的贡献者依然会持续获得回报。这才是为开源 AI 构建一套公平经济的方式。\n\n目前最能打的产品是 GRID：一个分布式 AI 网络，把复杂任务切分后交给最合适的模型，再拼合出答案。现在已经接入了上百家 Web2 与 Web3 项目。\n\n在研究层面，他们也在推进几条关键路线：\n▪️ Dobby 系列开源模型：覆盖不同规模与对齐程度\n▪️ Open Deep Search 与 ROMA：面向搜索和多代理递归解决复杂任务\n\n我觉得到时候可能会高开，随时保持关注。Sentient 属于社区💗。",
