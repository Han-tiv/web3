> >Trigger
> Binance spots an oracle bug and drops/reduces the messed up OKX spot price from its index.
>  
> >How It Works
> ~60% of the index came from Binance futures, creating a self-feeding feedback loop. Remove the bad data → index & mark price crash.
>  
> >Immediate Effect: Binance futures tanks. Mark price dives to true on chain value. Long positions get liquidated.

> /FINAL PART: The Two Ways the $SLERF Game Could End
>  
> Let's review what happened before.
>  
> >The Setup
> Spotting the Opportunity
> Traders noticed $SLERF on OKX had very low liquidity and deposits/withdrawals were paused.
>  
> >Phase 1
> Traders bought and sold $SLERF on OKX, pushing its spot price up.
>  
> >Phase 2
> The higher price on OKX affected Binance futures’ mark price because of how the index is calculated. And This mark price rise then fed back into the index due to a self-reference.
> This caused short positions to liquidate, creating a feedback loop.
>  
> >Phase 3
> Traders who had positions on Binance futures made profits as the price effect spread.
>  
> So… $SLERF relied on two fragile points.
>  
> Break either one, and the game’s over, just differently.

> Subject: Formal Complaint – Market Manipulation, Malicious Liquidations & Regulatory Breaches by @Backpack Exchange
>  
> To:
> @SECGov   |  @CFTC   |  @FinCENnews   |  @FBI   |  @MAS_sg   |  @ESMAComms
> Also cc: @Backpack | @Backpack_CN | @armaniferrante
>  
> Complainant: Joe shao 🇺🇸   Email: jwfv4n@163.com
> Date: October 19, 2025
>  
> ⸻
>  
> Summary
>  
> This complaint concerns @Backpack, operated by @armaniferrante (backpack.app), for its October 11 2025 mass liquidations that allegedly wiped users—even neutral hedged positions—through manipulated internal pricing and defective risk controls.
> Multiple users (notably @river_bluffer threads) document severe losses and non-transparent liquidation logic, suggesting market manipulation, operational negligence, and regulatory non-compliance.
>  
> ⸻
>  
> Key Allegations
> 1.Manipulated Liquidation Prices
> Internal spot quotes deviated 20–24%, causing margin calls on positions neutral to the broader market. Users lost up to –$39 000 on hedged trades.
> → Possible SEC Rule 10b-5 / CEA 6(c)(1) violations.
> 2.ADL & Risk-Control Failures
> ADL closed only derivative legs, leaving spot exposure. “Safe hedge” marketing misled users; insurance funds not applied.
> → Misrepresentation / fraudulent inducement.
> 3.Liquidity Shortfalls & Artificial Wicks
> Empty order books on BTC/SOL pairs; no market-maker backup or circuit-breaker.
> → Potential CEA 9(a) artificial-price creation.
> 4.Refusal to Compensate & Opaque Fees
> Support tickets closed; “KFC promotion” mocked users. Liquidation fees raised 0.5%→1% without notice or refund.
> → Violates CFTC Reg. 1.55 / 17 CFR 166.3 (transparency & fair dealing).
>  
> ⸻
>  
> Evidence (available on request)
> •Public threads by @river_bluffer show price gaps and user losses.
> •Screenshots: liquidation times, margin ratios, TX hashes, support IDs.
> •Archived ToS (Oct 2025) lacks multi-venue index or circuit breaker clauses.
> •@Backpack posts advertising EU/US availability contradict jurisdiction claims.
>  
> ⸻
>  
> Requested Actions
> 1.Investigate pricing, liquidation, and risk systems of @Backpack.
> 2.Assess offering of unregistered derivatives to US/EU/SG users.
> 3.Order restitution and publish investor alerts if violations confirmed.
> 4.Coordinate cross-border enforcement among @MAS_sg and @ESMAComms.

> Yes. You've described the fundamental mechanic of many low-cap plays. It's not good or evil. That's the core of the play, and why dissecting it is so valuable.

> By studying these plays, we learn to read the flow of liquidity, whether to follow it or to get out of its way.
>  
> It's a public market, but not a fair one. Awareness is the only edge for the rest of us.

> *Binance's futures use the OKX spot price as an oracle reference.
> 👇
> *Because the OKX price was pushed up, the oracle reference price increased, which in turn drove the Binance contract price higher.

> Systemic Vulnerabilities
> •High Leverage & Liquidation Cascades: USDe and sUSDe used in looping & as collateral → price dip triggers auto-liquidations → negative feedback loop.
> •Fragile sUSDe Liquidity: Thin On-chain liquidity → significant depeg drains pools → potential DeFi bad debt.
> •Dependence on Incentives: Most liquidity driven by campaigns (e.g., Ethena’s “Sats”) → unsustainable if incentives stop.

> The Death Spiral Part
>  
> Prices dipped.
>  
> Some big player, likely an institution, got liquidated on Binance using USDe as collateral.
>  
> USDe was force-sold, crashed to $0.62, system snapped.
>  
> Chain reaction:
> •Loopers wiped → flooding the market with USDe.
> •Market makers using USDe as margin lost ~50% instantly.
> •Liquidity vanished.
>  
> Small caps didn’t just drop — they evaporated (-80% to -90%).
>  
> Even after a slight rebound, most of them still ended up down 20% to 30%.

> 前几天才从 Sentient 这里撸了一条毛巾，今天又偷偷找老板们撸了点邀请码。邀请码听说场外已经炒到100U了，所以抽2个给我的粉丝宝宝们！！！
>  
> Sentient 在我看来是关注基础层面重构 AI 的权力分配，背后站着的机构也极为顶级——虽然目前只开了一轮种子轮融资，但已经拿下了 85M，这是很高很高的融资了，在早期阶段就吸引了大基金的下注。
>  
> 他们要解决的核心问题是：
> 当 AI 模型被广泛使用时，数据提供者、微调者、过滤者这些贡献者，能否得到公平、自动、无需信任假设的回报？
>  
> Sentient 给出的答案是一个「对齐协议」。
> 贡献者把自己训练或处理过的模型提交到平台，开发者和企业则下载并在应用或内部工具中使用。关键点是：模型的使用会在链上被追踪，回报透明地分发回贡献者。
>  
> 这个系统的基础就是 OML 框架：
> 1. Open：模型可下载、可运行
> 2. Monetizable：使用情况可验证、可追踪
> 3. Loyal：v1 还有限制，但未来版本会更好地 enforce 使用规则
>  
> 追踪可以通过 TEE 或 AI 原生加密证明来实现；Fingerprinting 技术保证即便模型开源，贡献者的归属也不会被遗忘。
>  
> 这意味着：即使模型已经共享给世界，它的贡献者依然会持续获得回报。这才是为开源 AI 构建一套公平经济的方式。
>  
> 目前最能打的产品是 GRID：一个分布式 AI 网络，把复杂任务切分后交给最合适的模型，再拼合出答案。现在已经接入了上百家 Web2 与 Web3 项目。
>  
> 在研究层面，他们也在推进几条关键路线：
> ▪️ Dobby 系列开源模型：覆盖不同规模与对齐程度
> ▪️ Open Deep Search 与 ROMA：面向搜索和多代理递归解决复杂任务
>  
> 我觉得到时候可能会高开，随时保持关注。Sentient 属于社区💗。

> Vana 原生 app 上线啦。
>  
> 先回顾一下背景：Vana 起源于 MIT 的一个项目，目标是让用户掌控自己的数据，同时参与 AI 模型训练。过去一年，Vana 生态慢慢成熟，用户突破百万，DataDAO 覆盖健康、社交等领域，社区活跃度提升。但入口比较分散，生态价值还没完全释放。
>  
> 这次原生 app 上线，把这些功能整合在一起：
> 1. 数据整合：集中管理个人数据
> 2. 参与 DataDAO：贡献数据到集体数据池
> 3. 数据应用：基于 Vana 的应用可以直接使用你的数据
>  
> 同时推出的 VanaXP，可以理解为你的生态贡献记录：通过连接数据、贡献 DataDAO、参与社区活动获得积分。XP 决定你在生态里的早期访问权、社区投票权，以及未来可能的奖励和质押机会。
>  
> 原生 app 的推出意味着 Vana 终于把之前分散的功能集中管理了，我觉得使用起来更顺手了。积分机制能识别真实贡献者，为未来应用打基础。对用户来说，现在参与主要是建立声誉和未来权益，而不是立刻变现。
>  
> App 这次是 邀请码制，官方社区和活跃用户会发，没拿到的可以先排候补～

> 0G 上线啦！
> 测试网数据很醒目：6.5 亿交易、2200 万账户，但更有意思的是它的布局和潜在影响。
>  
> 模块化设计让新 AI 项目可以快速接入，同时大厂还能保留定制化控制，这种开放又可控的矛盾，其实决定了它在未来生态里的战略位置。
>  
> 中国移动的背书不仅是 ToB 市场潜力的表面信号，更暗示运营商在算力和数据流通上开始试水——在内部，他们已经在讨论如何通过公链接入自己的 AI 服务。BitGo 托管则意味着机构资金早已开始悄悄布局，测试网阶段就有人在锁仓，这会让上线初期流动性呈现集中而非均匀分布的状态。
> 这么高的融资本质上显示机构对模块化 AI 公链生态潜力的认可。
>  
> 有消息说团队在和几家头部 AI 算力与数据服务公司做隐形对接，等上线就能快速形成基础生态。这意味着，短期内可能会出现节点+算力+资源被提前锁定的先发优势。
>  
> 0G 能否成为 AI 层的 Solana，不只是技术问题，而是生态、政策、企业合作与资本布局的综合体现。真正值得关注的是 上线后的实际算力使用情况、生态项目入驻速度以及机构资金动向。

> 以上希望大家能少走弯路，更高效地享受活动和生活。
>  
> 首尔交通高峰、餐厅起点人数、医美安全等细节都要注意，提前规划和预约会让体验顺畅很多。
>  
> 最近首尔白天温度约 28–30°C，夜间降至 17–19°C，整体晴朗适合出行，但早晚稍凉，建议带件薄外套。有时候会下雨，出行有时需雨伞。
>  
> 这份指南基于我个人经验，仅供参考，大家根据自身需求灵活调整哦！

> 5. 支付方式
>  
> 现金 vs 卡：首尔大部分地方支持信用卡（Visa/Master），强烈建议带一张Visa信用卡！
> 注意银联信用卡不一定能刷出来，但是 ATM 支持银联储蓄卡取现。部分 711 和 GS25 便利店有 ATM。
>  
> 移动支付：Apple Pay / Samsung Pay 在大部分商家可用，但部分小店可能只收韩卡或现金。所有便利店都支持支付宝和微信，很多店门口或柜台显示 ZeroPay 标志，这意味着支持支付宝和微信扫码支付，扫ZeroPay码即可。
>  
> T-money：地铁公交卡，存钱制，可用于打车、便利店、部分餐厅。

> Tintin的 KBW 住宿出行 & 美食 & 医美攻略
>  
> 在首尔生活这么久，参加过好几届 KBW 后，每天有不计其数的朋友来问我下面的问题，以下是Tintin的一些 KBW 生存指南，给大家提供一些参考，参上！
>  
> 1. 住宿 & 出行
>  
> (1) 住江南是刚需
> KBW 几乎所有会场场地都在江南，住在别的区等于每天堵在路上。
> 而且会议时间点正好卡在上下班高峰，打车1小时起步，非常不划算。
>  
> (2) 出行策略
> 能走就走：住江南基本都能步行到场馆。
> 能坐地铁别打车：首尔地铁比出租车快得多，尤其在高峰期。
> 打车备选：实在要打车的话，注意预留充足时间。
>  
> (3) 地图导航：韩国本地人都用 Naver Map（有步行、公交、地铁全套路线指引），配合 Google Maps 使用体验更完整。
