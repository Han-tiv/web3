      "content": "The recent flash crash exposed the truth: \nfast is easy, reliable is hard.\nIt’s still Uptober, but volatility has returned with a reminder – what endures isn’t hype, it’s architecture.\n\nETH and BTC are free to trade, with zero fees to grow traders and flow.Daily trading competitions reward real PnL and open interest.\n\nBut fees are just the surface, the real story is the credible path to bringing global capital markets onchain with Ethereum’s trading layer.\n\nArchitectures > slogans.\nSpeed matters. Security matters. But only architecture endures.\n\nToday\nReya is a high-performance perp DEX leveraging the Arbitrum Orbit stack\n\nTomorrow \nReya becomes Ethereum’s trading layer — the world’s first trading specific based rollup.\nNot an L2. A DEX enshrined in Ethereum’s L1.\n\nOne trading system where retail and institutions can trade any market with millisecond execution and Ethereum-grade assurance.\n\nProjects like Hyperliquid and Aster have shown how powerful fast, vertically integrated venues can be. They’ve built deep liquidity and loyal users, proving the demand for onchain speed. Reya extends that proof by anchoring performance to Ethereum, where liquidity, infrastructure, and long-term trust already exist.\n\nReal capital markets depend on three things.\n\nSecurity and finality: Settlement and verification anchored to Ethereum’s validator set, with a path to hundreds of thousands of validators sequencing and attesting to every trade.\n\nComposability: Native integration with Ethereum’s DeFi stack: LSTs, RWAs, restaking, and collateral innovation.\n\nDistribution: Ethereum already has the builders, liquidity, and institutions. Reya connects directly to that network.\n\nFast is easy. Truly decentralised is hard. Reya is both.\n\nPerp DEXs today compete for the same pool of traders. Reya widens the market.\n\nCeFi-level execution with Ethereum-grade settlement lets traders move from custodial to self-custody without losing performance or taking on the risks of a small validator set.\n\nThat shift unlocks the full stack of onchain markets — perps, spot, staking, RWAs, and basis strategies — all under one unified margin system.\n\nEthereum still lacks a flagship L1-anchored perp venue. Reya is built to become that trading layer: fast, composable, and verifiable at the core of Ethereum’s financial stack.\n\nToday: a zero-gas, MEV-free perp DEX with yield-bearing margin.\n\nNext: a trading specific based rollup with settlement verified by Ethereum’s validator network, expanding toward a future of distributed sequencing and validator participation at scale.\n\nPerformance wins the moment.\nAlignment wins the decade.\nReya is built for both — the execution layer of Internet Capital Markets. On Ethereum.",

Over the past two weeks, the team has worked tirelessly to strengthen the architecture to handle this new scale. Yesterday’s volatility proved that work has paid off – providing traders with a venue they can be confident in all conditions.\n\nReya’s mission is to bring global capital markets onchain, building open, high performance infrastructure where traders can rely on the system even in the most volatile conditions. The next step on that journey is our Based Rollup design, which will scale to multiple execution nodes (no single sequencer risk) and inherit Ethereum’s full liveness and censorship guarantees. Days like these are a reminder that these properties rarely matter until they are the  only things that do.\n\nWe know many of our users - traders - are going to be hurting right now. But we hope you take some consolation from the fact we’re building Ethereum’s Trading Layer together. You will ultimately own the trading system designed to endure and scale into the next era of global capital markets. And we’re excited to be building it with you 💚",

      "content": "“Based rollup”\nDecentralization doesn’t matter ...until it does\n\nA based rollup derives sequencing and settlement directly from the Ethereum L1. Unlike typical L2s or app-chains, it doesn’t depend on a small external or ‘permissioned’ sequencer set.\n\nThis difference is critical.\nMost trading venues rely on a handful of operators to order transactions. If those few actors are compromised, coerced or offline for any reason: \nThe market stalls.\nLiquidity freezes.\nYour access disappears.\n\nReya removes that risk.\nAs a based rollup, sequencing happens via Ethereum itself – secured by hundreds of thousands of validators. No 'trusted' middlemen. \nNo regulatory chokepoints. \nNo downtime.",

      "content": ".@reya_xyz just hit $1B Perp volume in the last 30 days 🚀\n\nAnd honestly, I feel this is just the start… \n\nLet me share why Reya is growing so fast & why it’s becoming a top choice for traders 👇\n\nBack in April, Reya had only $94.4M monthly volume.\n\nIn just 4 months → it scaled to $1B monthly volume. Absolute insane growth 🔥\n\nBut what's the reason behind this growth...\n\n1️⃣ New markets = They started launching new markets faster, which is attracting lot of fresh users.\n\n2️⃣ Pre-market trading = Recently they launched $XPL token in Pre-market.\n\n3️⃣ Commodities trading = They are also launching Commodities. Recently launched PAGX (Gold). If you are a forex trader. You should try Reya. \n\n4️⃣ XP → RCP upgrade = Earlier, Reya had an XP system that was unlimited and unevenly distributed. This created imbalance and didn’t reward users fairly. \n\nThe team upgraded it to RCP (Reya Chain Points) with a fixed distribution, capped supply, and clear earning mechanisms.\n\n5️⃣ Special free trading events → 0-fee campaigns on new pairs/markets. These are short campaigns which lasts for only 1 or 2 days.\n But Right now, 7-day free ETH trading is live.\n\n💡 For traders: these campaigns = more profit.\n💡 For the network: this = more adoption.\n\nNow let’s talk about fees... Which is the best part⚡️\n\nReya has ultra-low fees compared to other DEXs. \n\nLet's Do one comparison:\n\nIn the last 30 days:\n\nReya generated $1.098B volume with only $127K fees paid.\n@tradeparadex generated $6.022B volume, but users paid $1.4M fees.\n\nEven adjusted to $1B volume, Paradex users pay $233K fees, which is almost 2x Reya’s fees.\n\n⚡️ On top of that:\nZero MEV\nSuper fast execution\nSmooth trading experience you can feel while using Reya.\n\nIf we talk about trust → Reya is backed by @cbventures  , @sandeepnailwal  (Polygon) @fabric_vc .  \n\nFinally, big congratulations to @0xSimonJones, @ggBrokoli, @Maho1284979, @charlesholgate  and the entire Reya team. You guys are doing an amazing job, and I truly appreciate the work your whole team is putting in.",

It ensures neutral profit and loss settlement between traders and automatically wraps USDC for collateral in margin accounts. Users can unwrap rUSD anytime, unless it's locked as margin.\n\n➠ Future Developments:\n\n~ Native Yield Generation: Transition from passive settlement to active yield generation within rUSD itself.\n\n~ Protocol Layer Integration: Deep integration into trading and clearing modules for seamless operations.\n\n~ Universal Network Currency: Usage for all fees, insurance, and governance within the network.\n\n➠ Yield-Bearing Stablecoin\n\n~ srUSD is a tokenized version of staked rUSD, earning yield through Reya’s unified liquidity model. Staking rUSD to receive srUSD allows users to earn passive yield while still using srUSD as trading margin. It supports cross-margining, enabling a single balance to back multiple positions, enhancing capital efficiency.\n\n➠ Key Benefits:\n\n~ Automatic Yield Accrual: Yield accrues automatically without the need for manual claiming.Telegram\nCross-Margin Support: One balance backs multiple positions, optimizing capital usage.\n\n~ Capital Efficiency: Same funds work for both liquidity provisioning and trading.\n\n~ Reya Network's innovative approach to stablecoins and liquidity provisioning is setting new standards in the DeFi space. By participating in staking and utilizing srUSD, users can enhance their capital efficiency and earn passive yield, all while contributing to a more resilient and integrated DeFi ecosystem.",
