> The recent flash crash exposed the truth:
> fast is easy, reliable is hard.
> It’s still Uptober, but volatility has returned with a reminder – what endures isn’t hype, it’s architecture.
>  
> ETH and BTC are free to trade, with zero fees to grow traders and flow.Daily trading competitions reward real PnL and open interest.
>  
> But fees are just the surface, the real story is the credible path to bringing global capital markets onchain with Ethereum’s trading layer.
>  
> Architectures > slogans.
> Speed matters. Security matters. But only architecture endures.
>  
> Today
> Reya is a high-performance perp DEX leveraging the Arbitrum Orbit stack
>  
> Tomorrow
> Reya becomes Ethereum’s trading layer — the world’s first trading specific based rollup.
> Not an L2. A DEX enshrined in Ethereum’s L1.
>  
> One trading system where retail and institutions can trade any market with millisecond execution and Ethereum-grade assurance.
>  
> Projects like Hyperliquid and Aster have shown how powerful fast, vertically integrated venues can be. They’ve built deep liquidity and loyal users, proving the demand for onchain speed. Reya extends that proof by anchoring performance to Ethereum, where liquidity, infrastructure, and long-term trust already exist.
>  
> Real capital markets depend on three things.
>  
> Security and finality: Settlement and verification anchored to Ethereum’s validator set, with a path to hundreds of thousands of validators sequencing and attesting to every trade.
>  
> Composability: Native integration with Ethereum’s DeFi stack: LSTs, RWAs, restaking, and collateral innovation.
>  
> Distribution: Ethereum already has the builders, liquidity, and institutions. Reya connects directly to that network.
>  
> Fast is easy. Truly decentralised is hard. Reya is both.
>  
> Perp DEXs today compete for the same pool of traders. Reya widens the market.
>  
> CeFi-level execution with Ethereum-grade settlement lets traders move from custodial to self-custody without losing performance or taking on the risks of a small validator set.
>  
> That shift unlocks the full stack of onchain markets — perps, spot, staking, RWAs, and basis strategies — all under one unified margin system.
>  
> Ethereum still lacks a flagship L1-anchored perp venue. Reya is built to become that trading layer: fast, composable, and verifiable at the core of Ethereum’s financial stack.
>  
> Today: a zero-gas, MEV-free perp DEX with yield-bearing margin.
>  
> Next: a trading specific based rollup with settlement verified by Ethereum’s validator network, expanding toward a future of distributed sequencing and validator participation at scale.
>  
> Performance wins the moment.
> Alignment wins the decade.
> Reya is built for both — the execution layer of Internet Capital Markets. On Ethereum.

>  
> ✅ no downtime
> ✅ no insolvencies
> ✅ stable execution and spreads across all markets
>  
> ADL also worked as designed, though in some scenarios it can be better reflected on the dApp. We will work hard to improve this.
>  
> This comes shortly after Reya crossed $1B in daily trading volume for the first time, a milestone that placed unprecedented load on our systems. Over the past two weeks, the team has worked tirelessly to strengthen the architecture to handle this new scale. Yesterday’s volatility proved that work has paid off – providing traders with a venue they can be confident in all conditions.
>  
> Reya’s mission is to bring global capital markets onchain, building open, high performance infrastructure where traders can rely on the system even in the most volatile conditions. The next step on that journey is our Based Rollup design, which will scale to multiple execution nodes (no single sequencer risk) and inherit Ethereum’s full liveness and censorship guarantees. Days like these are a reminder that these properties rarely matter until they are the  only things that do.
>  
> We know many of our users - traders - are going to be hurting right now. But we hope you take some consolation from the fact we’re building Ethereum’s Trading Layer together. You will ultimately own the trading system designed to endure and scale into the next era of global capital markets. And we’re excited to be building it with you 💚

> “Based rollup”
> Decentralization doesn’t matter ...until it does
>  
> A based rollup derives sequencing and settlement directly from the Ethereum L1. Unlike typical L2s or app-chains, it doesn’t depend on a small external or ‘permissioned’ sequencer set.
>  
> This difference is critical.
> Most trading venues rely on a handful of operators to order transactions. If those few actors are compromised, coerced or offline for any reason:
> The market stalls.
> Liquidity freezes.
> Your access disappears.
>  
> Reya removes that risk.
> As a based rollup, sequencing happens via Ethereum itself – secured by hundreds of thousands of validators. No 'trusted' middlemen.
> No regulatory chokepoints.
> No downtime.

> - TGE
> The tokenomics are almost finalized, it will take about two more weeks. So the TGE will definitely take place in Q4 this year.
>  
> - Airdrop
> Plan to allocate at least 45% to the community. Can’t specify the exact initial percentage yet.
>  
> - Token
> There will be buybacks from revenue. Its utility lies in blockchain integration, enabling high speed orders, and it can also be used for margin.
>  
> - Technology
> Deep liquidity – allows listing any instrument for which there is an oracle. Supports simultaneous transactions on both ETH and Reya.
>  
> - Spreads
> They try not to list pairs where it could be too large, so the passive pool can hedge without issues. For all other pairs, it’s average for the market.
>  
> - OG Users
> For OG users, especially those who participated in Voltz, a surprise is being prepared. Detailed information will be available soon.

> .@reya_xyz just hit $1B Perp volume in the last 30 days 🚀
>  
> And honestly, I feel this is just the start…
>  
> Let me share why Reya is growing so fast & why it’s becoming a top choice for traders 👇
>  
> Back in April, Reya had only $94.4M monthly volume.
>  
> In just 4 months → it scaled to $1B monthly volume. Absolute insane growth 🔥
>  
> But what's the reason behind this growth...
>  
> 1️⃣ New markets = They started launching new markets faster, which is attracting lot of fresh users.
>  
> 2️⃣ Pre-market trading = Recently they launched $XPL token in Pre-market.
>  
> 3️⃣ Commodities trading = They are also launching Commodities. Recently launched PAGX (Gold). If you are a forex trader. You should try Reya.
>  
> 4️⃣ XP → RCP upgrade = Earlier, Reya had an XP system that was unlimited and unevenly distributed. This created imbalance and didn’t reward users fairly.
>  
> The team upgraded it to RCP (Reya Chain Points) with a fixed distribution, capped supply, and clear earning mechanisms.
>  
> 5️⃣ Special free trading events → 0-fee campaigns on new pairs/markets. These are short campaigns which lasts for only 1 or 2 days.
> But Right now, 7-day free ETH trading is live.
>  
> 💡 For traders: these campaigns = more profit.
> 💡 For the network: this = more adoption.
>  
> Now let’s talk about fees... Which is the best part⚡️
>  
> Reya has ultra-low fees compared to other DEXs.
>  
> Let's Do one comparison:
>  
> In the last 30 days:
>  
> Reya generated $1.098B volume with only $127K fees paid.
> @tradeparadex generated $6.022B volume, but users paid $1.4M fees.
>  
> Even adjusted to $1B volume, Paradex users pay $233K fees, which is almost 2x Reya’s fees.
>  
> ⚡️ On top of that:
> Zero MEV
> Super fast execution
> Smooth trading experience you can feel while using Reya.
>  
> If we talk about trust → Reya is backed by @cbventures  , @sandeepnailwal  (Polygon) @fabric_vc .
>  
> Finally, big congratulations to @0xSimonJones, @ggBrokoli, @Maho1284979, @charlesholgate  and the entire Reya team. You guys are doing an amazing job, and I truly appreciate the work your whole team is putting in.

> Reya Network is redefining DeFi with its innovative stablecoin architecture: rUSD and srUSD.
>  
> ➠ The Core Settlement Stablecoin
>  
> ~ rUSD is reya native, chain-agnostic stablecoin, currently implemented as wrapped USDC bridged directly onto the @reya_xyz  Network. It ensures neutral profit and loss settlement between traders and automatically wraps USDC for collateral in margin accounts. Users can unwrap rUSD anytime, unless it's locked as margin.
>  
> ➠ Future Developments:
>  
> ~ Native Yield Generation: Transition from passive settlement to active yield generation within rUSD itself.
>  
> ~ Protocol Layer Integration: Deep integration into trading and clearing modules for seamless operations.
>  
> ~ Universal Network Currency: Usage for all fees, insurance, and governance within the network.
>  
> ➠ Yield-Bearing Stablecoin
>  
> ~ srUSD is a tokenized version of staked rUSD, earning yield through Reya’s unified liquidity model. Staking rUSD to receive srUSD allows users to earn passive yield while still using srUSD as trading margin. It supports cross-margining, enabling a single balance to back multiple positions, enhancing capital efficiency.
>  
> ➠ Key Benefits:
>  
> ~ Automatic Yield Accrual: Yield accrues automatically without the need for manual claiming.Telegram
> Cross-Margin Support: One balance backs multiple positions, optimizing capital usage.
>  
> ~ Capital Efficiency: Same funds work for both liquidity provisioning and trading.
>  
> ~ Reya Network's innovative approach to stablecoins and liquidity provisioning is setting new standards in the DeFi space. By participating in staking and utilizing srUSD, users can enhance their capital efficiency and earn passive yield, all while contributing to a more resilient and integrated DeFi ecosystem.

> The Native Stablecoin Stack of Reya Network 🪙
>  
> Reya introduces rUSD & srUSD - two core stablecoin primitives powering settlement, liquidity, and capital efficiency across the Network.
>  
> rUSD: The Settlement Stablecoin
>  
> What it is: Reya’s native, chain agnostic stablecoin.
>  
> Current form: Wrapped USDC bridged directly onto Reya Network.
>  
> Role in the system:
> ~ Ensures neutral PnL settlement between traders.
>  
> ~ Automatically wraps USDC for collateral in margin accounts.
>  
> ~ Unwrappable anytime (unless locked as margin).
>  
> Future Roadmap for rUSD:
> ~ Native Yield: Move beyond passive settlement - rUSD itself will generate yield.
>  
> ~ Protocol Layer Integration: Deeply embedded into trading & clearing modules.
>  
> ~ Universal Network Currency: All fees, insurance, and governance denominated in rUSD.
>  
> srUSD: The Yield Bearing Stablecoin
>  
> What it is: A tokenized version of staked rUSD.
>  
> How it works:
>  
> ~ Stake rUSD - receive srUSD.
>  
> ~ srUSD earns yield via Reya’s unified liquidity model.
>  
> ~ Value of srUSD appreciates automatically (no manual claiming).
>  
> Benefits:
> ~ Earn passive yield while still using srUSD as trading margin.
>  
> ~ Cross-margin support - one balance backs multiple positions.
>  
> ~ Capital efficiency - same dollar works for both liquidity & trading.
>  
> Reya’s Liquidity Engine 🚂
>  
> ~ Traditional DeFi liquidity = siloed pools, fragmented capital.
>  
> ~ Reya = unified liquidity dynamically allocated across strategies:
>  
> ~ Market neutral trades (cash & carry, arbitrage).
>  
> ~ Liquidity provisioning (Reya’s AMM for perps).
>  
> ~ Partnering with Amber, Selini & Elixir to maximize LP returns.
>  
> Track record since launch:
> ~ Avg. 10.45% APY.
>  
> ~ Only 6 negative days since Dec ’24.
>  
> ~ Minimal drawdowns (-0.27bp).
>  
> Risks to Know
> ~ Market Risk: Negative funding rates or adverse price moves.
>  
> ~ Smart Contract Risk: Despite audits, bugs can exist.
>  
> ~ Counterparty Risk: Exposure via centralized exchanges & Liquidity Managers.
>  
> USDC De-peg Risk: Since rUSD is wrapped USDC.
>  
> Using srUSD in Practice
>  
> ~ Stake rUSD - get srUSD.
>  
> ~ srUSD accrues yield automatically.
>  
> ~ Use srUSD as margin collateral on Reya DEX.
>  
> ~ srUSD is non-transferable (for now), but fully usable inside the ecosystem.
>  
> ~ srUSD also accrues Liquidity XP boosts (up to 15x with loyalty).
>  
> FAQ 👇
>  
> Q: Difference between rUSD & srUSD?
>  
> rUSD = neutral settlement & staking base.
> srUSD = yield-bearing version, usable as margin.
>  
> Q: Can I redeem srUSD back to rUSD?
>  
> Yes, anytime via dApp.
>  
> Q: Do I need to stake srUSD separately for yield?
>  
> No. Yield accrues automatically.
>  
> Q: Does srUSD affect my XP boosts?
>  
> No, XP continues as normal (plus loyalty boosts).
