The real world is uncertain, and @Polymarket quantifies that uncertainty with probabilities.\n\nSo if it's not \"Polymarket predicted X and X did/didn't happened\"—if it just outputs probabilities—how do you measure how predictive Polymarket actually is? \n\nStatisticians already have a tool for this, called the Brier Score. Brier Scores basically tell you: \"when you say an outcome is ~60% likely to happen, do those things happen 60% of the time?\" Same for 10%, same for 90%, and so on.\n\nHere's what that looks like for Polymarket, @Dune dashboard by @alexmccullaaa 👇\n\nFor Brier Scores, smaller is better. Anything below 0.1 is generally fantastic. (Sports betting lines tend to be around 0.2). Polymarket's Brier Score is 0.056, which means it is extremely accurate at surfacing correct probabilities.\n\nTakeaway: Polymarket is very accurate, but it's subtle what that means and how it's measured.",

      "content": "I turned a $25 Polymarket deposit into $26,664 PnL. Here is the journey:\n\nI was watching election night live and saw Polymarket in action. Soon after, I deposited ~$25, placed a few bets, then basically forgot about it. Two months later I checked back and the small account had doubled.\n\nThat's when I dug a bit deeper into the platform and discovered Polymarket rewards for providing liquidity. I experimented with placing limit orders in illiquid markets when I was bored. Over ~3 months (while barely active), I turned the ~$50 into ~$1,200: about -$200 from trades but +$1,400 from rewards.\n\nThen I decided to actually trade. I joined some Discord servers and talked to new people (I also started separate Polymarket accounts). During the action-packed June (US-Israel strikes on Iran), I grew the $1,200 into $10,000 in just 33 days.\n\nAfter that, I went mostly inactive for 50 days, only placing the occasional bet. PnL stayed flat with small spikes.\n\nIn mid-August I started actively trading again. In the ~50 days since, I've grown the account to $26,664 PnL.\n\nFor transparency: I've traded crypto before and now run multiple Polymarket accounts (though these aren't included in the PnL here). I could have redeposited funds at any time, but I still followed strict risk management (no single bet over 20% of the portfolio). There were also some non-trade transactions (refunds, alpha sharing, poker). I tried to keep these off this account to keep the portfolio size clean, but they probably nudged the numbers slightly.\n\nSo while I called it \"$25 to $26,664,\" the more accurate description is a $1k to $27k run in 4-5 months of trading. But since my name is 25usdc, I'll have to stick with the first version.\n\nGoing forward, I'll use this account to share opinions on bets, updates on my trades, and my ongoing journey in prediction markets. Next milestone: $100k. Let's see how far this $25 can go.",

      "content": "Polymarkets on everything 🔮 \n\nSo incredible to see ICE (the owner of @NYSE) invest $2 billion into @Polymarket, & share that @foundersfund led a $150 million round earlier this year. \n\nWhen we first invested in 2023, we were excited that their volumes were picking up — at around $10 million per month. They’ve now consistently been doing over $1 billion in volume per month, and last month did over $1.4 billion. We believe @shayne_coplan and team are building a true zero-to-one product — effectively a new financial instrument — in an early yet blossoming new market. And Polymarket’s partnership with ICE will only continue to drive prediction markets (as well as other exciting collaborations between the two, like tokenization) to the mainstream. Metamask & others are also planning to integrate Polymarket markets directly into their UI.\n\nPolymarket was Joey and I’s first crypto growth deal, as well as our first consumer crypto investment. We have watched Shayne & team effectively will a new category into existence, and keep 100% conviction (even during tough times) that prediction markets built via defi would be generational. Their product obsession + pulse on culture + creativity & execution is so impressive.\n\nLastly: it's worth noting that @joeykrug has believed in prediction markets for over a decade, and actually built the first decentralized one — Augur — on Ethereum in 2014 (before Ethereum even had stablecoins). His vision was prescient, and we are thrilled to see prediction markets come to life via Polymarket.",
