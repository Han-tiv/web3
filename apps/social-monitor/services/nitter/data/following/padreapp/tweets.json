A functional on-chain trading terminal, fast transactions and features that actually make trading easier and smarter. Currently at sub 14.7 MC, the team is coming with a big utility dropping Jan 16th. The PumpFun Sniper is already live and it’s hands down the best automation tool for sniping PumpFun tokens. I can't wait to see what the team has in store plus bagging $PADRE before then might be the play!",

      "content": "Guys, apart from good alpha you need proper tools to win in this market. Like I mentioned 3 weeks ago, I only use @PadreApp for trading:\n\ntrade.padre.gg/rk/ez_money ‼️\n\nI mostly trade on mobile, and honestly, this terminal is unmatched for mobile trading. Here's a quick tutorial on how to set it up and why it gives you the edge:\n\n🟣 I recommend signing up with Telegram as your notifications will be set automatically\n🟣 Save Padre on your home screen as a mobile app – full desktop experience on mobile. Way better than other apps in browsers, plus you get full-size candlestick charts\n🟣 Quick apes: copy i.e. my TG call :sunglasses: (whole message), hit Paste CA, and you’re on the most optimal market ready to buy\n🟣 Jeet Grid (base & pro) is 🔥 – see what early buyers are doing (holding, jeeting, buying more). How to access: token view > Data tab > click those colored numbers in ‘first buyers'\n🟣 Easy Limit Orders + auto-exit (TP/SL): example - I set a buy dip where I expect the price to drop + auto sell at target. Set and forget. (example:  buy dip for 1 sol when the price goes -30%, then auto Take Profit when price goes +50% and auto Stop loss when it goes -15%)\n🟣 Tracked wallet groups: see them directly on the chart and now another top feature: rotate your phone for full-size candlestick charts\n\nI’ve many apps, TG bots etc, but tbh $PADRE PWA on mobile is the best. Super quick switching between apps makes trading so much easier, tracking PnL etc etc \n\nAlso $PADRE hit $29.2mil so far, currently on a dip at $13.8mil and holding for the second day running, I’m bidding more here 📈\n\ndexscreener.com/ethereum/0x3…",
