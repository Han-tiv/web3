      "content": "Jupiter Ultra V3 🌐\n\nI usually don’t dont do this but… today I gotta put you all on game. \n\nDon’t matter if you new to crypto, in the trenches or building DeFi infra you MUST READ this!\n\nUltra V3 is harder, better, faster, stronger ok we get it but WHY?\n\nFirst off, WHY is it faster? \nUltra V3 got this beast called ShadowLane, an in house transaction engine that's like a ninja for landing your trades. No more pinging random RPCs or waiting on public relays that slow everything down. It uses real time data streams (think sub second precision) and smart priority fees to bundle and blast your txns straight to validators. Result? Trades land in 0-1 blocks (50-400ms latency), vs. the old 1-3 blocks. 95% of swaps under 2 seconds. It's like upgrading from dial up to fiber your swaps zip through without the latency.\n\nBetter execution? FUCK YEA but WHY?\nThey layered in Predictive Execution, which simulates your trade on-chain in real time before sending it (using stuff like Exponential Moving Average on historical data). It predicts slippage and tweaks on the fly for the best price. Plus, meta aggregation pulls from Jupiter's new Iris router (smarter than their old Metis) and tons of liquidity sources, auto sideline crappy ones via self learning. Oh, and Real Time Slippage Estimator (RTSE) dynamically sets your max slippage based on token vibes, market chaos, and failure rates. Over 7 days of vol weighted data, it's netting +0.6 bps positive slippage while competitors are bleeding -1 to -14 bps. Your trades actually hit better prices, not worse.\n\nSafer + more privacy, thanks to ShadowLane: \nThis is the star. It's fully private no selling your order flow to shady MEV bots or third party relays. Everything stays in house. Jupiter handles the whole txn lifecycle with encrypted bundles and direct validator handoffs. No exposure to front running creeps. It's got built in token shields too (scans for rugs/malicious code). Feels like trading in a vault 😏 I've had zero weird fails since testing it.\n\nDon’t get Sandwiched (on-chain): \nSandwich attacks suck bro 😭bots front run your buy, pump the price, then dump after. Ultra V3 crushes this with 34x better protection (per their data vs. top terminals). HOW? By keeping execution 100% internal. No external providers get a peek, so no MEV searchers can snipe you. ShadowLanes private landing + Predictive sims make it near impossible for sandwiches to sneak in. Sandwiched .me \nstats back it! Lowest value extracted per volume on Solana. Your $10k swap won't get eaten alive anymore.\n\n8-10x lower fees (gasless swaps where possible, JIT revivals for dead markets), and it's plug & play across web,mobile,desktop and API. No config BS.\n\nAt the end of the day THERE IS NOTHING LIKE ULTRA V3 ANYWHERE 🫵🪐\n\nJust use Jupiter.",

We are also rolling out the Ultra API to allow our partners to utilize the best-in-class routing/transaction landing infra behind Ultra v3.\n\nCurrently, many meta routers and many others are still using our sunsetted Jupiter Legacy API (Metis). We will be working with them to upgrade their routing to adopt the new Ultra API.\n\nIf you are using Jupiter Legacy API in your app, please correctly label to avoid misleading your users that this is the best price from Jupiter. In particular, certain apps are using the free binary, which is deprecated and we have no control over the results, and it is very discouraging to see certain platforms abuse something that we have offered to the ecosystem for free for years.",

It accurately predicts potential slippage, intelligently prioritizes routes, and ultimately gives you the best possible outcome and price at the point of execution, not just at the point of quotation.\n\nOn top of that, Predictive Execution performs just in-time simulations for every route, uses signaling to help Prop AMMs to quote tighter for non-toxic flow versus toxic flow – allowing Jupiter Ultra users to get better pricing.\n\nWith this, quotes reflect actual likely on-chain execution, not theoretical best-case scenarios. No inflated “best prices” or tricks to delude.\n\nPredictive Execution also includes RTSE, the most advanced slippage estimator in DeFi, worked on for over 2 years.\n\nWhat you see is what you get.

More room before liquidations\n\nLiquidation LTV increased from 86% ⇒ 95%. Your position won’t be liquidated until your debt reaches 95% of the value of your collateral. This gives you more breathing room during periods of volatility.\n\n3. Lower liquidation penalties\n\nLiquidation fees reduced from 6% ⇒ 2%. In the event of a liquidation, you’ll pay 67% less.\n\nTaken all together:\n• Larger Loans\n• Higher Liquidation Thresholds\n• Less Liquidation Fees\n\nThe same JLP Loans that you’ve come to love, but improved across every metric.\n\nRead more about it here: discuss.jup.ag/t/adjustment-…",

      "content": "A Fresh Start for $JUP (Major Changes Coming)\n\nThis one is for the token holders. The ride or dies. The folks who have held through up and down, supporting a project they believe has the ability to change the future of finance.\n\nWe know it hasn’t been easy lately.\n\nBut here’s the good news: we hear you. And we’re moving to make changes inspired by your ideas and our deep reflections on what $JUP should be.\n\nIn classic Jupiter style tho, this is going to be a somewhat long essay. Before we can step into the new future, we must acknowledge the past and clearly articulate how we’re changing our approach going forward.\n\nBut if you read the whole essay, you’ll find 3 major changes that demonstrate how important your feedback has been over the last few weeks/months.\n\n—-\nReflections on $JUP\n\nThe $JUP token was initially aimed to be the lynchpin of the Jupiter DAO. That worked quite well to kick things off.\n\nTogether, we built the largest and most active DAO ever. We regularly had hundreds of thousands of voting wallets, voted on 20+ proposals, and pioneered concepts like Active Staking Rewards before anyone else.\n\nIn a time where it’s rare to see DAO proposals get more than 100 voters, we showed it was possible to build governance that massive numbers of people cared about. We likely experimented the most amongst all the major protocols about what it means to be a community, a DAO and a platform - and we most certainly learnt a ton.\n\nBut there were also problems that only became obvious over time. Specifically:\n\n- Mechanics of governance turned some potential holders away from the token - for example, the frequency of voting and the 30 day lockup.\n\n- We were spending too much time and energy on public comms around the DAO, reducing the amount of attention on the Jupiter product suite and the overall Jupiter mission\n\n- Budgeting votes for Work Groups created a massive divide in the token holder base and drew negative attention to $JUP\n\nAll these, combined, had one MAJOR disadvantage - attention was consistently drawn away from the great work of the team/community towards things that drew the ire of token holders.\n\nFundamentally, the previous setup was not additive to the $JUP token.\n\nTo move forward, we need to keep what was good, and change what was not.\n\n/// Major Change #1: Scaling Back the DAO\nAfter countless conversations with token holders, it’s clear that the Jupiter DAO is an important vehicle.\n\nMany $JUP holders believe deeply in the power of community governance, and are excited to be able to share their opinions and shape the future of Jupiter.\n\nBut these conversations have also made clear that the DAO should be laser-focused on extremely high-leverage actions. The constant flow of votes was a drain on token holder attention, especially when vote subjects felt “small”.\n\nThe other thing was that the votes, a major major driver of community attention, constantly drawn attention to, and vastly\n\nGoing forward, the DAO will have a narrower focus on broad tokenomics decisions and major treasury stewardship items.\n\nThis means no more Work Groups, fewer overall votes, and more focus in our public comms on products and growth.\n\nToken Holders can rest assured the conversation about Jupiter will not be dominated by politics, while still being able to effectively drive decision making around key items that affect our collective future.\n\nWe are also going to be refocusing the community energy away from politics and towards a pro-social core mission - onboarding the world to DeFi - as will be explained in a separate community post by @AlleyCatNY.\n\n/// Major Change #2: Reducing the Unstaking Window\n\nInitially, we created a 30 day lockup on staked tokens. Given that Active Staking Rewards were high and governance votes were very frequent, this made sense to ensure only those who were longer term aligned with the Jupiter mission would be able to participate.\n\nBut now, we stand at a critical juncture. The key is not only to find long-term aligned holders, but to create more of them. And, as we’ve heard from many token holders, the unstaking window of 30 days is too long and turns away potential buyers (particularly large-scale institutional buyers).\n\nTo meet in the middle, we are going to reduce the unstaking period to 7 days without any penalty. This ensures those who are participating in governance are not simply buying/dumping $JUP to cast a vote, while still giving token holders the flexibility they want and need.\n\nThis change should go live in the coming weeks.\n\n/// Major Change #3: Burn the Litterbox (subject to a DAO vote)\n\nFinally, to kick off this new chapter of the DAO, we want to start with a critical vote that has been the subject of MANY conversations with token holders: the Litterbox Trust.\n\nThe Litterbox Trust receives 50% of protocol revenues from Jupiter and uses those revenues to accumulate $JUP from the open market.\n\nIt currently holds over 121m tokens (~1.7% of the total supply, ~3.8% of circulating supply), and grows every hour.\n\nThe original plan was to hold a DAO vote after 2 years to decide what to do with the accumulated tokens. But we’ve heard two different critiques.\n\nFirst, some token holders have suggested that holding a large amount of $JUP without clarity on how the tokens will be used is creating uncertainty. By far the most common suggested solution is to “burn” these tokens.\n\nSecond, some token holders have suggested that the buybacks themselves are not particularly effective. The solutions for this are more varied - some want continuous burns, some want increased investment in product growth, and some want other use cases of the revenue.\n\nDeciding what to do with 1) the current $JUP holdings and 2) the ongoing revenues are both massive decisions. They are the perfect example of the types of decisions that the DAO can and should have active input on.\n\nStarting today, we’ll hold a period of public discussion on the first question (Burning the Litterbox). This will continue for ~10 days, with a formal vote to Burn the Litterbox’s existing holdings shortly thereafter.\n\nAfter that, we will have a separate conversation about whether the $JUP Accumulation Plan should be continued, or if there are much better uses for the revenue.\n\nIf you’re a token holder, now is the time to make your opinion known, and to get involved again in meaningful governance!\n\n–\n\nAll three of these changes are concrete and tangible, but I want to also point out a more philosophical change that’s taken place within the team.\n\nFor a long time, we didn’t give JUP the type of attention we give to our products. Each product has a clear value proposition, a marketing plan, iterative improvement process, etc.\n\nAnd for a long time, JUP didn’t have this. We expected the market to understand the value of JUP based on the strength of our products, community, and vision. That was a mistake. And one that we are already in the process of fixing.\n\nGoing forward, we’re going to give JUP the attention it deserves.\n\nWe need to be incredibly vocal about the Jupiter story, about the JUP story, and about the story of DeFi going forward.\n\nAnd we’re going to be having more conversations in public about other long term use cases for JUP that will integrate into the future of Jupiter platforms.\n\nSo here’s my free advice - if you’re tired of seeing talk of Jupiter, switch to Bluesky 😉",

Will just prioritize the substance over the fluff in a short-ish post. \n\nBetter communication was one of the main takeaways from our offsite, and I'm going to give that a go.  \n\nThe Product. Studio will build towards 3 verticals - memecoin / community launches, custom launches (for brands etc) and permissioned capital formation via DTF. The launchpad product as is will be made more memecoin and trader friendly, both from UI/UX perspective and also from a fees perspective.   \n\nThe Strategy. We will back world-class memes and communities like uranus and help develop playbooks to bring them to mainstream success, living beyond CT and outlasting cycles. We will back brands and projects with potential as they start out their journey, again in bespoke manners, using Jupiter's influence and distribution. We are here to stand behind communities, creators and projects that develop real momentum.   \n\nWhat We Do. We give momentum to what deserves it. When we amplify, we will do it with precision. We support community-led marketing initiatives that turn heads, connect them to the right people, listings, advisors, market makers, collaborations, and people of influence. Whoever can make the difference, we find them. The success of deserving projects is our priority.   \n\nThe Economics. None of Studio's accrued fees will go to the team and none have been deployed to date. All the amounts we have invested into Studio and its ecosystem to date is fresh liquidity from Jupiter. Accrued fees to date (about 3.5m) will be split between the Studio ecosystem and the Litterbox Trust. Fees in the future will be recycled into the Studio ecosystem until Studio stabilizes as a leading product, following which 50% will go towards the Litterbox.   \n\nWe’re not here to chase noise, fuck about and farm fees.  \n\nWe're here to build the future of monies.\n\nThanks for staying with us as we launched v0 of Studio. v1 starts now.",
