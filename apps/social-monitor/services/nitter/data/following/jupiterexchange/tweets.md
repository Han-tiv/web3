> Jupiter Ultra V3 🌐
>  
> I usually don’t dont do this but… today I gotta put you all on game.
>  
> Don’t matter if you new to crypto, in the trenches or building DeFi infra you MUST READ this!
>  
> Ultra V3 is harder, better, faster, stronger ok we get it but WHY?
>  
> First off, WHY is it faster?
> Ultra V3 got this beast called ShadowLane, an in house transaction engine that's like a ninja for landing your trades. No more pinging random RPCs or waiting on public relays that slow everything down. It uses real time data streams (think sub second precision) and smart priority fees to bundle and blast your txns straight to validators. Result? Trades land in 0-1 blocks (50-400ms latency), vs. the old 1-3 blocks. 95% of swaps under 2 seconds. It's like upgrading from dial up to fiber your swaps zip through without the latency.
>  
> Better execution? FUCK YEA but WHY?
> They layered in Predictive Execution, which simulates your trade on-chain in real time before sending it (using stuff like Exponential Moving Average on historical data). It predicts slippage and tweaks on the fly for the best price. Plus, meta aggregation pulls from Jupiter's new Iris router (smarter than their old Metis) and tons of liquidity sources, auto sideline crappy ones via self learning. Oh, and Real Time Slippage Estimator (RTSE) dynamically sets your max slippage based on token vibes, market chaos, and failure rates. Over 7 days of vol weighted data, it's netting +0.6 bps positive slippage while competitors are bleeding -1 to -14 bps. Your trades actually hit better prices, not worse.
>  
> Safer + more privacy, thanks to ShadowLane:
> This is the star. It's fully private no selling your order flow to shady MEV bots or third party relays. Everything stays in house. Jupiter handles the whole txn lifecycle with encrypted bundles and direct validator handoffs. No exposure to front running creeps. It's got built in token shields too (scans for rugs/malicious code). Feels like trading in a vault 😏 I've had zero weird fails since testing it.
>  
> Don’t get Sandwiched (on-chain):
> Sandwich attacks suck bro 😭bots front run your buy, pump the price, then dump after. Ultra V3 crushes this with 34x better protection (per their data vs. top terminals). HOW? By keeping execution 100% internal. No external providers get a peek, so no MEV searchers can snipe you. ShadowLanes private landing + Predictive sims make it near impossible for sandwiches to sneak in. Sandwiched .me
> stats back it! Lowest value extracted per volume on Solana. Your $10k swap won't get eaten alive anymore.
>  
> 8-10x lower fees (gasless swaps where possible, JIT revivals for dead markets), and it's plug & play across web,mobile,desktop and API. No config BS.
>  
> At the end of the day THERE IS NOTHING LIKE ULTRA V3 ANYWHERE 🫵🪐
>  
> Just use Jupiter.

> Jupiter was the best swap on Solana - your go-to place for any token pairs. But with the newest V3 update it also became the best trading platform too - with peak speed, accuracy & privacy.

> Most accurate quotes, reduced chance of getting MEVd by 82x, new cool “token revival” feature & new pricing efficiency that’s 10x cheaper than competitors make it a one-in-all DeFi tool for any $SOL trading activity

> Best-in-Class MEV Protection – 34x Better Than Top Trading Terminals
>  
> Other providers increase your risk of being sandwiched by selling your order flow to third-party MEV searchers.
>  
> Ultra v3 does the opposite – it minimizes your exposure to toxic MEV by ensuring your trades are never handed off to any external provider for on-chain execution.
>  
> And while the risk isn’t zero (since validators still broadcast to the chain’s leaders), Ultra brings it as close to zero as possible.

> Ultra Signaling: Even better pricing for Ultra Users
>  
> Prop AMMs are a big deal recently because they can quote very tightly on-chain for users.
>  
> But they have to play defense with toxic traders like arb bots, toxic takers, etc. So, when quoting on-chain, they have to be careful to not quote too tightly (better price) to prevent being abused by these toxic traders.
>  
> Ultra Signaling is built directly on-chain on our Jupiter Aggregator contract to detect non-toxic flow on-chain. One of the Prop AMMs we are working with is now quoting 3 bps tighter (50% better) for our Ultra users with this signal.

> Predictive Execution: Smart Route Prioritization For Superior Execution
>  
> Optimized for execution and slippage – not quote-optimized illusions.
>  
> Most platforms “catfish” you with prices that don’t reflect the on-chain reality, or worse yet, mislead you into thinking they are showing the best price from Jupiter.
>  
> Predictive Execution goes beyond just simulating routes. It accurately predicts potential slippage, intelligently prioritizes routes, and ultimately gives you the best possible outcome and price at the point of execution, not just at the point of quotation.
>  
> On top of that, Predictive Execution performs just in-time simulations for every route, uses signaling to help Prop AMMs to quote tighter for non-toxic flow versus toxic flow – allowing Jupiter Ultra users to get better pricing.
>  
> With this, quotes reflect actual likely on-chain execution, not theoretical best-case scenarios. No inflated “best prices” or tricks to delude.
>  
> Predictive Execution also includes RTSE, the most advanced slippage estimator in DeFi, worked on for over 2 years.
>  
> What you see is what you get. Every swap lands exactly as promised. Executed in the best way possible, at the best price, every time.

> JLP Loans just got better for borrowers!
>  
> After extensive analysis, we’ve implemented 3 key changes to make JLP Loans even more competitive:
>  
> 1. Borrow more upfront
>  
> Max LTV increased from 83% ⇒ 90%. Take out larger initial loans against your collateral, now up to 90% of its value.
>  
> 2. More room before liquidations
>  
> Liquidation LTV increased from 86% ⇒ 95%. Your position won’t be liquidated until your debt reaches 95% of the value of your collateral. This gives you more breathing room during periods of volatility.
>  
> 3. Lower liquidation penalties
>  
> Liquidation fees reduced from 6% ⇒ 2%. In the event of a liquidation, you’ll pay 67% less.
>  
> Taken all together:
> • Larger Loans
> • Higher Liquidation Thresholds
> • Less Liquidation Fees
>  
> The same JLP Loans that you’ve come to love, but improved across every metric.

> A Fresh Start for $JUP (Major Changes Coming)
>  
> This one is for the token holders. The ride or dies. The folks who have held through up and down, supporting a project they believe has the ability to change the future of finance.
>  
> We know it hasn’t been easy lately.
>  
> But here’s the good news: we hear you. And we’re moving to make changes inspired by your ideas and our deep reflections on what $JUP should be.
>  
> In classic Jupiter style tho, this is going to be a somewhat long essay. Before we can step into the new future, we must acknowledge the past and clearly articulate how we’re changing our approach going forward.
>  
> But if you read the whole essay, you’ll find 3 major changes that demonstrate how important your feedback has been over the last few weeks/months.
>  
> —-
> Reflections on $JUP
>  
> The $JUP token was initially aimed to be the lynchpin of the Jupiter DAO. That worked quite well to kick things off.
>  
> Together, we built the largest and most active DAO ever. We regularly had hundreds of thousands of voting wallets, voted on 20+ proposals, and pioneered concepts like Active Staking Rewards before anyone else.
>  
> In a time where it’s rare to see DAO proposals get more than 100 voters, we showed it was possible to build governance that massive numbers of people cared about. We likely experimented the most amongst all the major protocols about what it means to be a community, a DAO and a platform - and we most certainly learnt a ton.
>  
> But there were also problems that only became obvious over time. Specifically:
>  
> - Mechanics of governance turned some potential holders away from the token - for example, the frequency of voting and the 30 day lockup.
>  
> - We were spending too much time and energy on public comms around the DAO, reducing the amount of attention on the Jupiter product suite and the overall Jupiter mission
>  
> - Budgeting votes for Work Groups created a massive divide in the token holder base and drew negative attention to $JUP
>  
> All these, combined, had one MAJOR disadvantage - attention was consistently drawn away from the great work of the team/community towards things that drew the ire of token holders.
>  
> Fundamentally, the previous setup was not additive to the $JUP token.
>  
> To move forward, we need to keep what was good, and change what was not.
>  
> /// Major Change #1: Scaling Back the DAO
> After countless conversations with token holders, it’s clear that the Jupiter DAO is an important vehicle.
>  
> Many $JUP holders believe deeply in the power of community governance, and are excited to be able to share their opinions and shape the future of Jupiter.
>  
> But these conversations have also made clear that the DAO should be laser-focused on extremely high-leverage actions. The constant flow of votes was a drain on token holder attention, especially when vote subjects felt “small”.
>  
> The other thing was that the votes, a major major driver of community attention, constantly drawn attention to, and vastly
>  
> Going forward, the DAO will have a narrower focus on broad tokenomics decisions and major treasury stewardship items.
>  
> This means no more Work Groups, fewer overall votes, and more focus in our public comms on products and growth.
>  
> Token Holders can rest assured the conversation about Jupiter will not be dominated by politics, while still being able to effectively drive decision making around key items that affect our collective future.
>  
> We are also going to be refocusing the community energy away from politics and towards a pro-social core mission - onboarding the world to DeFi - as will be explained in a separate community post by @AlleyCatNY.
>  
> /// Major Change #2: Reducing the Unstaking Window
>  
> Initially, we created a 30 day lockup on staked tokens. Given that Active Staking Rewards were high and governance votes were very frequent, this made sense to ensure only those who were longer term aligned with the Jupiter mission would be able to participate.
>  
> But now, we stand at a critical juncture. The key is not only to find long-term aligned holders, but to create more of them. And, as we’ve heard from many token holders, the unstaking window of 30 days is too long and turns away potential buyers (particularly large-scale institutional buyers).
>  
> To meet in the middle, we are going to reduce the unstaking period to 7 days without any penalty. This ensures those who are participating in governance are not simply buying/dumping $JUP to cast a vote, while still giving token holders the flexibility they want and need.
>  
> This change should go live in the coming weeks.
>  
> /// Major Change #3: Burn the Litterbox (subject to a DAO vote)
>  
> Finally, to kick off this new chapter of the DAO, we want to start with a critical vote that has been the subject of MANY conversations with token holders: the Litterbox Trust.
>  
> The Litterbox Trust receives 50% of protocol revenues from Jupiter and uses those revenues to accumulate $JUP from the open market.
>  
> It currently holds over 121m tokens (~1.7% of the total supply, ~3.8% of circulating supply), and grows every hour.
>  
> The original plan was to hold a DAO vote after 2 years to decide what to do with the accumulated tokens. But we’ve heard two different critiques.
>  
> First, some token holders have suggested that holding a large amount of $JUP without clarity on how the tokens will be used is creating uncertainty. By far the most common suggested solution is to “burn” these tokens.
>  
> Second, some token holders have suggested that the buybacks themselves are not particularly effective. The solutions for this are more varied - some want continuous burns, some want increased investment in product growth, and some want other use cases of the revenue.
>  
> Deciding what to do with 1) the current $JUP holdings and 2) the ongoing revenues are both massive decisions. They are the perfect example of the types of decisions that the DAO can and should have active input on.
>  
> Starting today, we’ll hold a period of public discussion on the first question (Burning the Litterbox). This will continue for ~10 days, with a formal vote to Burn the Litterbox’s existing holdings shortly thereafter.
>  
> After that, we will have a separate conversation about whether the $JUP Accumulation Plan should be continued, or if there are much better uses for the revenue.
>  
> If you’re a token holder, now is the time to make your opinion known, and to get involved again in meaningful governance!

> All three of these changes are concrete and tangible, but I want to also point out a more philosophical change that’s taken place within the team.
>  
> For a long time, we didn’t give JUP the type of attention we give to our products. Each product has a clear value proposition, a marketing plan, iterative improvement process, etc.
>  
> And for a long time, JUP didn’t have this. We expected the market to understand the value of JUP based on the strength of our products, community, and vision. That was a mistake. And one that we are already in the process of fixing.
>  
> Going forward, we’re going to give JUP the attention it deserves.
>  
> We need to be incredibly vocal about the Jupiter story, about the JUP story, and about the story of DeFi going forward.
>  
> And we’re going to be having more conversations in public about other long term use cases for JUP that will integrate into the future of Jupiter platforms.
>  
> So here’s my free advice - if you’re tired of seeing talk of Jupiter, switch to Bluesky 😉

> Here's another long essay about @jup_studio with learnings from our offsite last week.
>  
> Ok no. Enough of that. Will just prioritize the substance over the fluff in a short-ish post.
>  
> Better communication was one of the main takeaways from our offsite, and I'm going to give that a go.
>  
> The Product. Studio will build towards 3 verticals - memecoin / community launches, custom launches (for brands etc) and permissioned capital formation via DTF. The launchpad product as is will be made more memecoin and trader friendly, both from UI/UX perspective and also from a fees perspective.
>  
> The Strategy. We will back world-class memes and communities like uranus and help develop playbooks to bring them to mainstream success, living beyond CT and outlasting cycles. We will back brands and projects with potential as they start out their journey, again in bespoke manners, using Jupiter's influence and distribution. We are here to stand behind communities, creators and projects that develop real momentum.
>  
> What We Do. We give momentum to what deserves it. When we amplify, we will do it with precision. We support community-led marketing initiatives that turn heads, connect them to the right people, listings, advisors, market makers, collaborations, and people of influence. Whoever can make the difference, we find them. The success of deserving projects is our priority.
>  
> The Economics. None of Studio's accrued fees will go to the team and none have been deployed to date. All the amounts we have invested into Studio and its ecosystem to date is fresh liquidity from Jupiter. Accrued fees to date (about 3.5m) will be split between the Studio ecosystem and the Litterbox Trust. Fees in the future will be recycled into the Studio ecosystem until Studio stabilizes as a leading product, following which 50% will go towards the Litterbox.
>  
> We’re not here to chase noise, fuck about and farm fees.
>  
> We're here to build the future of monies.
>  
> Thanks for staying with us as we launched v0 of Studio. v1 starts now.

> Jupiter Perps just got another major update:
> SOL positions now have a ~25% lower borrow fee.
>  
> What changed:
> When you open a leveraged position, the borrow fee is what you pay to take a loan on the additional capital.
>  
> For SOL this has historically been higher than the same positions on BTC or ETH.
>  
> But now these fees have been lowered by ~25% to reduce this discrepancy.
>  
> Same quality at a lower cost:
> Jupiter Perps are favored by traders as they have deep liquidity to guarantee your trades and allow for size.
>  
> Now we are bringing you the same quality you’ve come to expect, with lower fees.

> Friends & Family Event For Jupnet
>  
> Over the past 9 months, we have been working hard to lay the technical foundations for Jupnet, the omnichain liquidity hub.
>  
> To make it as transparent, open and decentralized while optimizing for the best possible user experience, we are working hard to develop 3 key frameworks:
>  
> 1️⃣Fully Integrated Native Omnichain Stack  - A novel hub-based messaging framework, Omnichain ledger, and services
> 2️⃣Privacy-focused User Account System – which enables onchain social authentications, MFA while being privacy-focused
> 3️⃣Practical Transaction Orchestration – which introduces Preferred Leaders, Batched Transactions, and Prioritised Sequencing
>  
> These frameworks are enabled by JupVM, a heavily modified version of SVM to empower the creation of powerful omnichain applications, such as an omnichain perps exchange, and an interchain token protocol.
>  
> We're hosting a small invite-only event to introduce our team & core ideas. This event will be technical and informal so come and hang out with us!
