They've built the world's first end-to-end eBay scraping auction tool that monitors thousands of auctions daily, uses proprietary pricing algorithms, and places bids on hundreds to thousands of cards simultaneously. No one else in the world has this capability.\"\n\n\"Their only real competitor - Courtyard, raised $43M while they raised <$3M. Yet, they have gotten to 2/3rds of Courtyard's revenue - and ONLY with Pokemon cards.\nThis ALL happened in the past 8 months - where they've had average monthly net revenue growth of 69% MoM\"\n\n\"Overall, the growth & size of this market is up and to the right. The final nail in the coffin for me is the simple fact that this is a trend that came back after 2021. As an outsider, it was quite obvious to me that 2021/2 was quite an amazing bubble for Pokemon cards, with celebrities like Logan Paul paying $5.2 million for a Pikachu graded PSA 10 in 2022. Obviously, NFTs were also doing extremely well - but one of these survived while the other didn't.\"",

Perps on stocks, leverage, incredible potential \n\nStablecoins before everyone else -> nah their revenues are bad, bad business. Not bad, best innovation of crypto though. But not THAT crazy... right?\n\nTradfi goes wild over it. 0 to 1 innovation that kills many intermediaries, biggest buyer of US T bills, revolutionizes spending & payments.\n\nTokenizatikn before everyone else -> nah nfts suck, no purpose, & tokenization is just a fad\n\nWe are here. Tokenization of highly valued collectibles makes alot of sense because it unlocks so much liquidity. We are just too used to it because we have been playing this game for the past 4 years.\n\nBut put yourself in the shoes of someone new. He wants to buy, say a highly expensive collectible. He goes online, chances are he will have to head down to the \"real world\" to get it. If it can be shipped, theres a dozen checks and balances in between - postage, authenticity, shipping, etc.\n\nBut here, he can own the underlying of the asset. \"That does nothing!\" you say. I disagree. As the owner, he can choose to redeem it - or choose to just hold the NFT. While redeemable, he has the OPTIONALITY not to - and that makes all the difference\n\nAdd in all the bits and pieces we've built in the past few years. Maybe give it a few months, he resells it higher. He makes a couple bucks of profit all without ever holding inventory. It also never leaves the suppliers warehouse. The collectible has changed hands, without any actual physical exchange.\n\nAnd if he so wanted to, in the future, he may just be able to take an online loan against the collectible. Not needing to go to a pawn shop, or any of that sort. Just chuck the NFT in a protocol, and unlock liquidity\n\nNone of these ideas are new, of course. They have been here since 2017. But that is precisely why so many crypto people will be sidelined. There is a obvious sense of resignation, that this will just \"end up in smoke as always\"\n\nAnd that is exactly how this space has been taken over by TradFi. They can dream the dream and see the vision, whereas we have stayed too close to the sausage factory, and been cut too many times.\n\nBut I digress. It's funny because we have been complaining for so many years that crypto was a solution looking for a problem.\n\nBut just like everything else we've seen this cycle - the problem is now staring at us in the face, but we look past it. All our applications have found PMF in slightly different ways - perp dexes for equities, stablecoins for payments, and now NFTs for tokenization. \n\nThis is the holy tripartite man. Perps, Stablecoins, Tokenization.",

      "content": "Pokémon and other TCGs are about to have their “Polymarket moment.” Here’s why you should be paying attention:\n\nMost of crypto’s teal world asset (RWA) plays cater to well-established TradFi markets, like treasuries, real estate, gold and stocks. Sure, tokenization brings these markets some efficiencies (24/7 trading & potential cost savings) and potentialities (lending collateralization) but it doesn't transform them fundamentally. Good-enough digital rails already exist.\n\nPokémon cards are different. They’ve already got a multi-billion dollar market, and yet, this market operates almost exclusively IRL. Sellers literally ship their charizard, pikachu, gardevoir, what have you to buyers – sometimes graded, often not. It's inefficient, but it works: social auction app Whatnot (just one corner of the market) generated $3 billion in sales last year, much from Pokémon.\n\nDespite its size (and the massive retail interest) this market remains largely informal. You don’t see Pokémon ETFs or investment funds, and you probably won’t for a while. But maybe not as long as you’d think.\n\n@Collector_Crypt is catching buzz this week for its tokenized Pokémon card marketplace. Basically, you can buy and sell digital versions of Charizard & Co in an instant, or deposit your collection to create NFTs for quick trading. It's not a new idea (plenty of tokenized trading card services exist) but it has a rare attribute: exit velocity.\n\nThe token CARDS (FDV $450M) is up 10x less than a week after launch. Traders are rushing to price in  revenue-generating potential. It is signaling annualized revenue of $38 million. A lot of the hype is the expectation that some of those yields will flow back to token buybacks.\n\nIn the short term, however, the token’s roaring success is putting eyeballs on CollectorCrypt and the entire tokenized Pokémon cards market. It's also fueling massive demand for the project’s “Gacha machine,” basically a digital vending machine that spits out surprise pulls. Call it gambling or whatever you like, its printing: $16.6 million last week alone. The team is now having trouble restocking the machine, demand is so high.\n\nI expect the Pokémon boom will be sticky – one of those moments where an “only in crypto” innovation breaks into the mainstream. Kinda like what polymarket did for prediction markets. Create global demand for a service that people really didn't think about before.",

Most high-end/high-tier purchases in the TCG realm are already handled via crypto, as per one of the biggest TCG whales in the world @MTG_AlphaInvest.\n\nCurrently the only ways to transact slabs reliably are through conventions or eBay. eBay charges an astounding ~15% rate in fees, whereas @Collector_Crypt has a real chance to be a disruptor with 4% rate. \n\n@Collector_Crypt simply just bridges the gap between the markets and unlocks a new layer of liquidity for collectors.\n\nAdditionally, their casino has been highly addictive attracting whales and normies alike into the TCG market. Only real question mark here is sourcing and keeping up with demand. I believe they currently source with RJS (big Pokemon TCG influencer), so they should readily have a network on-hand for grail-tiered items. \n\nThink this type of product has been what people have been waiting for all cycle. \n\nTL;DR:\nICM x RWA x TCG \neBay disruptor & Stake competitor for TCG\n\nSide Note:\nPretty surprised how little people knew there was an ongoing bullrun with the Pokemon & the overall TCG market. Was telling retail/normies to switch over to scalping cards earlier this year. There's dedicated subreddits simply for TCG investing and tons of success stories of people selling their collection for house down-payments.",

      "content": "Pokemon TCG RWA on Solana has been quietly gaining traction, having done over $6.4M in revenue and $95M in total volume so far, despite being a relatively new sector onchain.\n\n@Collector_Crypt, one of the earliest players remains the frontrunner, averaging over $1.2M/month in gross revenue (net of buybacks). Most of this revenue comes from Gacha where $49.5M+ has been spent by 3004 unique wallets on Collector Crypt, averaging $16.5k/user.\n\nGacha is the main revenue driver across the board with over $50M spent across the sector. Newer entrants like @TCG_Emporium and @Phygitals have already generated $163k and $665k respectively just from gacha spending alone, showing strong stickiness and spend despite much smaller user base for the TCG RWA sector.\n\nThese gacha systems are akin to IRL oripas (gambling blind box), offering instant buyback based on 80 – 85% of card value , speeding up the gambling loop. Platforms also offer attractive chases (e.g Collector Crypt has ponchos as chase for gacha), further boosting the engagement.\n\nThe secondary marketplace activity is growing too and while it is still smaller than gacha, it has recorded   marketplace volumes totalling up to $440k as a sector. \n\nEmporium recorded a $11.3k top sales for Mario Pikachu card and a top sales of $9.3k was also recorded on Collector Crypt for a Poncho Pikachu card recently. \n\nWhile relatively new, tokenization of TCG like Pokemon seems to see a PMF emerging, with high user spending despite low DAU. Perhaps it could help to solve existing problems on the Web2 front – fragmented liquidity, fraud in IRL oripas/rip & ship or high marketplace fees (eg eBay) and can unlock more offerings onchain with instant accessibilty. The numbers seen here is just a small slice of the broader TCG market, and perhaps there could be more room to scale and onboard more users.\n\nIs there any token for any of the 3?\n\n Not at the moment, but the closest will be Collector Crypt which will be launched on Metaplex Genesis launchpad soon. \n\nWill be interesting to see how this sector will play out eventually.\n\nFor more information on the numbers of Collector Crypt, Phygitals and Emporium, check out the Dune dashboard I created here:\n\ndune.com/zkayape/pokemontcgs…",

There is no one to blame for this, it's just the natural evolution of the game.\n\nTrading tech improved rapidly, ie: Axiom, KOLScan, wallet tracking etc, so the edge a lot of people had is now depleted, or easy to access, making it no longer an edge.\n\nAlso money has been on a continuous outflow, big money stopped playing these games a while ago. It is way, way more EV to just wait for semi-established things above say 10M now then blasting new pairs.\n\nSuccess stories is what bring people on-chain, and we lack them coming out of the Solana trenches right now.\n\nThere will be a new game to be played where tools are less defined, allowing the curious people to take lead. \n\nI see the new 'meta' being companies launching on Solana, TGE at higher valuations, pricing most 'trenchers' out because they believe there is not enough upside, and not having the patience research, or hang onto winners. *conditioned by the current state of the trenches*\n\nIt's clear this is what capital is most interested in. \n\nNo one is interested playing the same game as the guy who makes a montage of clipping 8 SOL of something at 500k and victory lapping it.",

      "content": "appreciate this explainer post! \n\ni think despite Shaw's flaws he was actually a net-positive character mainly because he was a PVE thinker and had a bigger perspective than pure competition\n\ni agree that core development on ElizaOS is mis-managed; they should have better focus and be more relentless in shipping and iterating\n\nhowever, the people and the vision behind ai16z was absolutely spot on in how the internet will be like in a few years\n\ni'm excited to realize this vision––many ai16z partners bought in early and we will also be collaborating on things like Clank Tank together. some have asked to relaunch their agents on daos fun and so we can work on that together\n\nwill write a longer post detailing what was wrong with prev agents meta and how we plan to fix those problems",

      "content": "i cant believe that i have to write this but the turnover on CT is so insane that people dont even know the lore behind daos.fun and why this launchpad and the $LLM token should be significant \n\n10 months ago the ai16z DAO was created on this platform. it featured the blonde ai companion Eliza as their mascot (waifu for lack of a better word) \n\nthe project was picked up on by mark andressen in the wake of the initial GOAT frenzy and he interacted back and forth, giving lots of publicity to the account \n\nthe token eventually ran to $2.5B \n\nShaw (the developer of eliza) was erratic and egotistical and self sabotaged the project many times over, causing many early supports - myself included, to jeet bags for multiples that pitied in the end to what we could have made \n\nthis token is what eliza should have been. @baoskee at daos.fun is imo the only reason ai16z was allowed to exist and spark such a movement in the first place \n\nnow that he is behind the scenes, no shaw involved, i am extremely bullish on what he is going to build \n\nwith grok x ani prevalence as well as how much gooning there is on a day to day basis the mascot alone commands a lot of memetic power and when coupled with a potential real product $15m is way too low",
