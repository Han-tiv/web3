      "content": "we grew from zero to $50M ARR in <2 years, profitably\ni've never publicly shared our tactics before\nit's cost us over $5M to learn what I'm about to share\n\n800-word long post on every growth hack that printed money for us\n\nI'll cover:\n1. Influencer Marketing\n2. Performance Marketing vs Brand\n3. User Testing\n4. Dogfooding\n\n0-10M was nearly 100% word of mouth and organic content\n\n10-50M was still >50% word of mouth but influencer, affiliate, and referral made up the other half\n\nBut the foundation we set from 0-$10M is what allowed us to blaze past $50M\n\n1. Influencer Marketing 101:\n\n90% of your reach comes from <10% of content that goes viral. Your job: go broad with influencers and spend enough to find that 10% of content and formats that work. Virality is no accident - test and discover hooks, visuals, formats for each platform, understand why they work, and replicate 100x across your influencer roster.\n\nMost startups get three things wrong:\n1 - Too small budget\n2 - Overly selective on creators and messaging\n3 - Give up too early\nStart with $10-20k/month, commit to 6 months minimum. This lets you experiment with many micro influencers and lets you test many concepts.\n\n- List creator personas with audiences that care about your product. Be exhaustive. Influencer outreach is time-consuming. Work with a freelancer or agency if you don't have a team. DM me for recommendations.\n\n- Offer base + viral bonus. For TikTok, have them start new accounts. New accounts can get as many views as established ones. But on new accounts creators are unburdened by their brand and can try any format.\n\n- Test across all platforms (TikTok, IG, X, LinkedIn work for most B2B/prosumer apps).\n\n- Track specific creators and hooks that outperform, not just channels.\n\n- Add 'How did you hear about us' to onboarding. Calculate which channels drive leads vs just views.\n\n- Compile every asset, video or hook that works into a guide. Once you have 20-30 winning formats, hire your top creators as consultants to train all other influencers on what angles go viral for you and why.\n\n- Never write scripts - it becomes an ad no one watches.\nCreators know their audience best.\n\n2. Invest in brand before performance marketing\n\nMost startups are not prepared to scale their spend because their brand and creative sucks. We had to go through an extremely expensive rebrand (both in terms of time and dollars spent) to land on something we loved. But it would have been much more expensive to skip this step.\n\nBe relentless about testing a wide range of creatives. Whatever number of creatives you're thinking of testing, 10x it. Be bold. See what moves the needle (CAC payback, conversion rates, LTV and retention).\n\nOnce you see a particular use case resonating, build a whole funnel around it with symmetric messaging. You don’t want to confuse visitors by showing them an ad with one value prop and then drop them on to a landing page with a completely different message.\n\n3. Get users to test prototypes before you ship.\n\nThis seems trivial, but saves you from the worst startup mistake - misdirected product development.\n\nMost startups think experimentation is for mature companies improving their funnel by 1% through a/b testing. But Gamma's founding team is early Optimizely folks. Experimentation is in our DNA.\n\nWe ran extensive user testing on platforms like voicepanel and usertesting\n\na. Recruited random people who make slide decks for work. They have no skin in the game and won't lie to be nice.\n\nb. Showed them prototypes with minimal instructions and let them spend a few minutes trying things out.\n\nc. Asked them to think out loud. The words they use to navigate, their expectations, where they get confused is gold. Combining their voice + screen actions amplifies things 10x. You really feel the pain of poor UX and overcomplicated copy.\n\nDid this for everything - landing pages, onboarding, new features, moonshot concepts.\n\nAlways test your biggest assumptions about what people will get or like. Identify major blind spots in your prototype stage, not at the end.\n\nShip once you have hours of testing proof that ordinary people find it easy and useful.\n\n4. Dogfood the hell out of your product\n\nEither you build something that's 100x better than alternatives, or you build something else. Dogfooding makes it painfully obvious if your product isn't a 100x better.\n\nStorytime: When we started Gamma, we had two competing ideas -\nIdea 1:  a virtual office to capture in-person magic\nIdea 2:  reimagining PowerPoint from the ground up (This became Gamma)\n\nAfter 6 months of building and dogfooding both of them in parallel, we had a clear winner.\n\nIt wasn't about metrics or hard data.\n\nWith a virtual office, we were always competing against IRL and could never replace the magic of being together in person.\n\nWith the reimagined PowerPoint, we could imagine a product 100x better than the alternative.\n\nAny startup can learn from our playbook.\nI really hope they do.",

Perps are a form of leveraged trading, and not every asset is suitable for leverage. Whether leverage works depends heavily on the underlying asset’s nature.\n\nYes/No tokens in prediction markets aren’t perpetual, linearly priced assets. Their price and liquidity can instantly drop to zero or fall 90%. This puts the leverage provider, whether it’s a perp market maker or a lending protocol lender, at a structural disadvantage compared to traders. If traders win, they can amplify gains through leverage while the leverage provider only earns APY. If traders lose, the leverage provider risks massive losses from delayed liquidations, similar to a total wipeout.\n\nSecondly, prediction market users simply don’t have much demand for perps, and that’s the most important point. I’ve interviewed many users, and Polymarket’s audience isn’t made up of hardcore gamblers who need sophisticated financial tools. In fact, Polymarket’s trading interface is extremely basic. Most users are there to trade for fun. They want more diverse and entertaining topics, not to look at MACD charts for prediction markets. The latter makes no sense, right?\n\nFinally, except for a handful of markets with deep order books and long lifespans, most Polymarket markets expire quickly, and their order book liquidity is often lower than memecoins. That makes designing perps for them even harder.",

When I first entered the space, I only held BTC/ETH and focused on delta-neutral strategies with a very low-risk preference. I wasn’t keen on altcoins or memecoins. Even now, I still don’t hold any altcoins outside of DeFi, but memecoins have changed my perspective.\n\nThe interesting thing about memecoins is that, compared to pure investments (or speculation), they carry more cultural significance. Trading memecoins isn’t much different from trading altcoins, but it’s undeniably more fun. The magic of the Crypto space lies in the fact that Crypto is an ideology—an ideology that can be monetized, making it easier to understand and amplifying its influence.\n\nPump.fun feels like TikTok—it enables the power of UGC. What Pump.fun did reminds me of my work at Kwai, which was the biggest competitor of TikTok in China and entered the short video field earlier than TikTok.\n\nAlthough my view on memecoins has changed significantly, I still rarely trade them (my colleague @0xcryptoblack , however, is the king of memes). For me, meme culture often has a high entry barrier, and the meme space tends to have a lot of market manipulation and noise.\n\nThat was until I discovered prediction markets. Prediction markets are currently the type of product in the Crypto space that align most closely with my preferences. I now spend more time on prediction markets than on delta-neutral strategies. The cultural fields covered by prediction markets are more mainstream, with lower entry barriers and less speculation and manipulation. I believe there’s more room for exploration here.\n\nAlthough both prediction markets and memecoins are, in a way, forms of 'information trading,' that doesn’t mean prediction markets are similar to memecoins. In my view, prediction markets are the opposite of memecoins, they have entirely different user profiles and dissemination mechanisms. Personally, I’m bearish on any “prediction markets version pump.fun”. The user of prediction market  are not-so-typical Crypto guy, as described in the interview.",

There's another arbitrage opportunity to earn some free money. \n\nRight now, Eigen on Bubbly is priced at $4.1, while it's $3.8 on @aevoxyz and @Bybit_Official . You can sell Eigen on Bubbly and long/buy Eigen on Aevo or Bybit.  You can arbitrage the 5% price difference and realize profits on the 30th. Considering the capital efficiency from collateral, the annualized APR could be as high as 182%  \n\nBTW, Bubbly currently has the highest volume and the deepest liquidity of @eigenlayer  compared to all pre-market platforms.",

I remember farming Swell points with swETH and using various DeFi protocols like Bunni and Pendle while I was still at Cobo. A lot has changed since then, Swell has evolved from an LSD protocol to LSD + LRT + L2, I leaved Cobo and started Bubbly Finance.\n\nThe Swell team is, without a doubt, one of the most knowledgeable in DeFi. They were pioneers of points and have done remarkable work in growing from a  LSD protocol to what it is today. Looking forward to building something truly unique for Swell in the future",

      "content": "Bubbly Finance @BubblyFinance  has officially launched and introduced Hyper Liquid Points! Right now, the price of Hyper Liquid Points is just $4—the lowest across all pre-market . Don’t miss out—grab your points today!\n\nBut wait, there are more reasons why you should use Bubbly Finance. Bubbly Finance is a pre-market platform based on an AMM, which has liquidity pools that make Bubbly unique.\n\nPrevious pre-market protocols, like @WhalesMarket  and its forks, were peer-to-peer based. This approach presents two major problems:\n\nOne major issue is that the efficiency of trading is extremely low. On Whales Market, buyers buy points or pre-launch tokens much like buying NFTs on OpenSea. This results in a poor user experience and weak liquidity. It doesn’t make sense to trade fungible assets in the same way as NFTs.\n\nAnother issue with Whales Market is that you can only \"buy,\" but you can't trade. After purchasing, you're forced to hold that position until the TGE; you can't sell to realize profits during a pump. The worst part is that you can only earn 2x, even if Hyper Liquid goes to the moon after the TGE, because the seller might default.\n\nIn my humble opinion, all these negative experiences stem from the peer-to-peer model. Buyers are limited to a specific counterparty, which causes them to lose flexibility. If we use a peer-to-pool model in the pre-market, we can address all these issues and fundamentally improve efficiency. It could be the Uniswap moment for the pre-market. An idea just came to mind...\n\nSo we built @BubblyFinance. The journey wasn’t easy—converting from a peer-to-peer model to a peer-to-pool model was far more complex than it might seem, but we did it. Now, with Bubbly, you can trade Hyper Liquid Points with the same simplicity you’d expect from Uniswap. You can buy the dip and sell the top, riding the waves until the TGE. No need to worry about your funds being locked, and your profits aren't limited to just 2x.\n\n----------------------------------- Tagging Hyperliquid Chads;​\n@crypto_adair @based16z @HWihler @NMTD8 @KingJulianIAm @chameleon_jeff @HyperliquidX @abhiii53 @ThorHartvigsen @stevenyuntcap @fiege_max @ericonomic @0x_Kun @ZacharyBrubake4 @0xOmnia @GreenGeorgeHL @sershokunin @GuthixHL @rektdiomedes @LouisCooper_ @Agonybeard @blocmatesdotcom @nazeoppa @0xAnteater @0xBebis_ @idrawline @CL207 @stoicsavage @blknoiz06 @HaizanAjide @alpha_pls @TheDeFinvestor @0xAndrewMoh\n-----------------------------------",
