I saw a tweet: “How did someone turn $100 into $100k in $TRUMP?”\n\nI had around $450 in my bank account and only one month of rent left. So, I thought, “Let’s take a risk with $250 and turn it into $250k.”\n\nAt first, I didn’t know about BullX, Photon, or Axiom. I started trading using DexScreener 😭😂. After some research… I LOST IT ALL.\n\nA month passed. I didn’t get a job, my rent money was gone, and I had to return home even though I didn’t want to.\n\nI noticed people with followers on X were earning more. So in February, I started my own X account for crypto.\n\nFirst I came with X of @Euris_x. I didn’t even know about @orangie and @Cupseyy at that time.I did not know what is wallet tracking, what the fhak is KOL.\n\nI thought, “Let’s give it a try. This time I’ll make it.”\nI took a $1000 loan, bought 3 SOL, and subscribed to 1 month of X Premium. LOST 90% of it all.\n\nThen, I came to know about Alpha Groups. My first Alpha Group was @Shocked, which I won in a giveaway from @kbz012 (the best trader and a great human, he has done more for me than anyone else on this planet. I’ll write more about him later in the thread).\nBy March, I had only 0.5 SOL left in my wallet  and an Alpha Group.",

The Narrative\n\n    People are changing their profile pictures to Clippy as a symbol of protest and unity against anti–consumer tech practices.\n\n    Clippy  the old Microsoft Office assistant represents a time when software was annoying but harmless, a nostalgic yet ironic throwback.\n\n2. Viral Boost from a Major Influencer\n\nPopular YouTuber Louis Rossmann (2.2M subscribers) dropped a video titled “Change your profile picture to Clippy. I’m serious.”\n\npiped.kavin.rocks/watch?v=qFe5LiAC…\n\nHe used Clippy as a meme to mock and protest modern anti–consumer tech behavior\n\n3. The Cult of Clippy\n\nWhat started as a protest quickly became a fun “Clippy cult.”\n \nStrong cultural resonance + viral influencer push = perfect memecoin pump fuel.\n\n👉 In short: $CLIPPY is pumping because it’s more than a meme  it’s a movement wrapped in nostalgia and rebellion.\n 7eMJmn1bYWSQEwxAX7CyngBzGNGu1cT582asKxxRpump",
