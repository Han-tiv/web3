> At long last the grifters and scammers of this space are trying to silence me with threats of lawsuits and lies. They do not know I will not back down and I will be willing to fight any and everything they throw at me in court or outside of it. First and foremost that image that was flagged as copyright infringement was an AI image thrown together under a James Wynn tweet so they have no legal ground in court. Second I have the funds/legal to battle any grifter in court. Third I will go ever harder towards the people I think are trying to get my account suspended. I am an advocate of free speech and I won’t be silenced or scared into submission.

> My Journey in Trench
>  
> In January, when Trump launched his memecoin, I was preparing for a job after being laid off for 7 months. I saw a tweet: “How did someone turn $100 into $100k in $TRUMP?”
>  
> I had around $450 in my bank account and only one month of rent left. So, I thought, “Let’s take a risk with $250 and turn it into $250k.”
>  
> At first, I didn’t know about BullX, Photon, or Axiom. I started trading using DexScreener 😭😂. After some research… I LOST IT ALL.
>  
> A month passed. I didn’t get a job, my rent money was gone, and I had to return home even though I didn’t want to.
>  
> I noticed people with followers on X were earning more. So in February, I started my own X account for crypto.
>  
> First I came with X of @Euris_x. I didn’t even know about @orangie and @Cupseyy at that time.I did not know what is wallet tracking, what the fhak is KOL.
>  
> I thought, “Let’s give it a try. This time I’ll make it.”
> I took a $1000 loan, bought 3 SOL, and subscribed to 1 month of X Premium. LOST 90% of it all.
>  
> Then, I came to know about Alpha Groups. My first Alpha Group was @Shocked, which I won in a giveaway from @kbz012 (the best trader and a great human, he has done more for me than anyone else on this planet. I’ll write more about him later in the thread).
> By March, I had only 0.5 SOL left in my wallet  and an Alpha Group.

> Why $CLIPPY PUMP ?
>  
> 1. The Narrative
>  
> People are changing their profile pictures to Clippy as a symbol of protest and unity against anti–consumer tech practices.
>  
> Clippy  the old Microsoft Office assistant represents a time when software was annoying but harmless, a nostalgic yet ironic throwback.
>  
> 2. Viral Boost from a Major Influencer
>  
> Popular YouTuber Louis Rossmann (2.2M subscribers) dropped a video titled “Change your profile picture to Clippy. I’m serious.”
>  
> piped.kavin.rocks/watch?v=qFe5LiAC…
>  
> He used Clippy as a meme to mock and protest modern anti–consumer tech behavior
>  
> 3. The Cult of Clippy
>  
> What started as a protest quickly became a fun “Clippy cult.”
>  
> Strong cultural resonance + viral influencer push = perfect memecoin pump fuel.
>  
> 👉 In short: $CLIPPY is pumping because it’s more than a meme  it’s a movement wrapped in nostalgia and rebellion.
