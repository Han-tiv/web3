> Pendle is building a future where everyone can earn fixed yield, from corporations like Walmart, to institutions like BlackRock, to everyday users around the world.
>  
> No matter who you are, the need is the same: predictable, secure yield that works transparently and at scale.
>  
> In traditional markets, investors take on credit and default risks for high-yield bonds. On Pendle, yields of similar or even better magnitude are already available, with arguable more compelling risk profiles.
>  
> To-date, Pendle has already settled over $69.8 billion of fixed yield, proving that the infrastructure works and the demand exists.
>  
> That’s why Fixed Yield is becoming the gateway for institutional participation in crypto. It’s familiar enough for traditional players to understand, yet innovative enough to unlock the next era of finance, one defined by transparency, composability, and accessibility.
>  
> Pendle has already become the foundation for yield in DeFi. Across major ecosystems, funds, and protocols rely on Pendle to price, trade, and manage yield exposure.
>  
> Now, we’re building the infrastructure and compliance framework to bring that same access to the traditional world at scale.
>  
> The $140 trillion global fixed income market shows the world’s appetite for stable yield is massive. What’s missing is a unified venue where every form of yield, from DeFi, CeFi, and TradFi, can converge.
>  
> That’s what Pendle is here to build.
>  
> Not just a platform for crypto yield, but the foundation for the world’s yield economy.

> "Our vision for Pendle is pretty ambitious. We want all yields to become tradeable on Pendle, not just DeFi ones, but across all types of yield globally. The idea is to build a yield market that can serve as the go-to venue for best-in-class yields, whether they come from DeFi, CeFi, or even TradFi."

> Pretty sick how @arbitrum has one of the best YBS opportunities via @USDai_Official’s $USDai $sUSDai  (currently topping @pendle_fi’s YBS leaderboard)
>  
> Best part about these yields is how it can be further amplified via @eulerfinance.
>  
> While $USDai deposits on Pendle are already maxxed out, its the staked version $sUSDai remains avail. for those still looking to max out yield exposure.
>  
> Even w/o leverage, PT-sUSDai is returning a solid 26.62% APY (top 3 across Pendle).
>  
> With looping, it scales aggressively → up to 3.98x leverage for an effective ~86.46% APY.
>  
> Here’s the loop structure in simple terms:
>  
> 1⃣ Zap into PT-sUSDai on Pendle
> 2⃣ Collateralise PT-sUSDai on @eulerfinance to borrow USDC
> 3⃣ Recycle that USDC back into more PT-sUSDai→ Rinse & repeat for compounding exposure.
>  
> This is easily one of the most efficient + scalable YBS yield strategies in the market right now, good time to take advantage of imo.

> We saw:
> 🔷$12.6m in liquidations
> 🔷$275.74m in trading volume
>  
> Rates also dropped to a record low on YU markets:
> 🔷BTC rates on Binance dropped to -17.3%, ETH dropped to -17.6%
> 🔷BTC rates on Hyperliquid dropped to -14.3%, ETH dropped to -335%
>  
> (Rates have now stabilized, with HL rates positive, and Binance rates close to negative)

>  
> the story that broke defi twitter
>  
> imagine launching a new product. watching $400 million flow in during your first week. that is exactly what happened when pendle landed on plasma october 2nd.
>  
> @pendle_fi  takes any asset that earns money and splits it into two parts. one part gives you steady fixed returns. the other lets you bet on whether yields will go up or down.
>  
> @Plasma  is peter thiel backed blockchain built specifically for stablecoins. their vision targets unbanked billions in emerging markets. 10%+ baseline yields that actually matter for wealth building.
>  
> when you combine pendle clever splitting with plasma stablecoin focus you get something special. this integration pushed pendle total tvl past $8.5 billion across all chains.
>  
> plasma became a key accelerator.
>  
> numbers that make whales pay attention
>  
> the growth happened faster than anyone expected.
>  
> - $318 million captured in first 96 hours
> - five pools launched with more coming weekly
> - effective yields up to 55% with peaks hitting 64% in optimal setups
> - strong trading volume shows real users not just hype
>  
> this speed beats most launches on ethereum and solana. people are not just depositing money and leaving. they are actively trading.
>  
> actively farming. actively building wealth.
>  
> how the magic actually works
>  
> think of it like splitting a rental property. you can sell the house for fixed price today. or keep collecting rent payments. pendle does this with crypto assets.
>  
> deposit your stablecoins and choose your path.
>  
> - safe route: lock in 25-30% fixed returns per year
> - risky route: bet on yields going higher for up to 55% potential with peaks to 64%
> - smart route: do both and hedge your bets
> - expert route: short yields if you think they will drop
>  
> as @DeFi_Dad  puts it "leveraged looping farms for you to earn triple digit yield." perfect for plasma stablecoin edge.
>  
> the triple reward system nobody talks about
>  
> here is where things get interesting. plasma gives out $900k worth of tokens weekly to pendle users. but you also earn from two other sources simultaneously.
>  
> the reward stack breakdown works like this.
>  
> - base yield from stablecoin protocols gives 8-30% yearly
> - plasma points offer variable upside for future airdrops
> - xpl tokens add 20-30% boost through weekly distributions
> - protocol bonuses from underlying platforms provide 5-15% extra
>  
> this creates income streams most people miss. you earn from multiple sources. without doing extra work.
>  
> real people making real money
>  
> community screenshots flooding twitter. users earning over $1000 in their first week. as pendle tweeted about their launch success user @St1t3h   posted exactly this from simple deposits into high yield pools.
>  
> as one trader posted "easiest money i have made this year just deposit and watch the numbers go up." the simplicity is what hooks people.
>  
> other community wins keep rolling in.
>  
> - $500 weekly income from $15k deposits
> - some users replacing full time salaries
> - strategies scaling from $5k to $500k positions
> - gas fees so low they barely register
>  
> the $1000 monthly math
>  
> want to make $1000 per month. here is the realistic breakdown using $20k.
>  
> path one works with direct USDe deposits. split into fixed 26% yearly part. then borrow against it at 20% yearly.
>  
> total return around 46% yearly gives you roughly $770 monthly.
>  
> path two starts with regular stablecoins. convert to earning USDe version. then split for 26% fixed yearly while keeping variable upside exposure.
>  
> total return hits up to 55% yearly with incentives. $800 to $950 monthly.
>  
> yields vary with market conditions and pool saturation. note that liquidity provider positions may face impermanent loss risks. always research thoroughly before depositing.
>  
> why this matters now
>  
> most yield farming burns out when incentives end. this setup feels different. because the underlying demand is real. pendle proved it on arbitrum with billions in tvl.
>  
> now supercharging plasma stablecoin dominance.
>  
> plasma focuses on stablecoins where people actually store wealth. while empowering emerging markets with accessible high yields.
>  
> pendle gives them tools to optimize returns. without complexity.
>  
> positioning advantages while early.
>  
> - incentive rewards still generous before dilution
> - pool sizes small enough for meaningful impact

> USDai's upward depeg is a fascinating case study into stablecoin mechanics, PT <> YT flows, and basic economic principles that underpin DeFi.
>  
> WTF is intern waffling about?
> Let me break this SILLINESS down and how YOU could have capitalized.
> ___________________________________________________
>  
> Unlike MOST depegged stablecoins, USDai by @USDai_Official depegged in an UPWARD direction. What this means is that traders are currently willing to pay more than $1 for something that should be valued EXACTLY $1.
>  
> Your first instinct is probably "what type of regard is buying $1 for more than $1" and I'd USUALLY be in agreeance.
>  
> The difference is that holding USDai gives users Allo Points which are being 'priced in' to the standard $1/USDai value.
>  
> "But wait... shouldn't every stablecoin with points also be valued > $1 then?"
>  
> ___________________________________________________
>  
> To answer this question, we need to understand how stablecoins maintain peg in the first place. The most common method is using a Peg Stability Module (PSM) which allows users to arbitrage mispricings while returning the stablecoin to peg:
> 1. Price < $1 → users buy stablecoin and redeem for $1 of underlying (or something similar)
> 2. Price > $1 → users mint stablecoin and sell for > $1
>  
> We are in Scenario 2. for USDai but there is an issue - USDai caps are fully filled so arbitrageurs CANNOT mint more to return it to peg!
>  
> The surge in demand for USDai's Allo Points WITHOUT the ability for new mints disrupts the stablecoin equilibrium.
>  
> As a result, USDai SHOULD be expected to be ABOVE peg until caps are raised.
> ___________________________________________________
>  
> The next thing you may have noticed is USDai's Implied Yield running to an absolutely SILLY 51.6% fixed APY, by far one of the highest yielding stables on the platform.
>  
> There is something CRITICAL to note here - Pendle prices assets in terms of the UNDERLYING token.
>  
> In our case, it is USDai which is currently trading at $1.06.
> A 51.6% fixed APY is based on this $1.06 face value.
>  
> What does this mean for you?
> > Buying PT-USDai will let you capture a fixed yield if you are ALREADY holding USDai.
> > If you are swapping in from USDC, there is a chance you'll end up with a loss in the event USDai repegs from $1.06 → $1
>  
> DEFINITELY exercise caution if you plan on entering PTs now.
> ___________________________________________________
>  
> One thing that is VERY interesting indeed is that if you were an early YT-USDai buyer, you are up heavily on both implied yield AND USDai/USD.
>  
> This should make sense since:
> 1. IY has spiked heavily from ~20% → 51.6%
> 2. USDai has depegged upwards from $1 → $1.06
>  
> While a large component of this IY spike can be attributed to demand for Allo Points, the rest is due to something a widdle bit more structural.
>  
> Recall that the thing that affects IY is trading activity of YT and PT:
> 1. IY ⏫ if people buy YT OR sell PT
> 2. IY ⏬ if people sell YT OR buy PT
>  
> In our case, we have PLENTY of people buying YTs.
> We do NOT have many people buying PTs since PTs are depegged upwards.
>  
> This means we're ultimately left with IYs that we can expect to continue an upward trajectory AT LEAST until USDai's underlying caps are raised!
>  
> ___________________________________________________
>  
> This is a neat little lesson into how caps on stablecoins can:
> 1. Cause price to depeg in an upward direction
> 2. Cause IY to spike in an upward direction
> 3. Both without standard market dynamics to bring them back to normal
>  
> If you are able to identify similar set-ups on Pendle's underlying stablecoins, it could VERY MUCH be possible to captures these opportunities.
>  
> Intern for one will be keeping a VERY close eye on said protocols and see where dem money bags be lying.

> It would seem that Pendle market is pricing sUSDe yield at ~4-5% APY, but Ethena data is projecting 10% APY.
>  
> If you're BULLISH market/funding, this would be a good point of entry for long yield, particularly for:
>  
> 🔹@terminal_fi tUSDe, which is getting 100% sUSDe yield, but has only been priced +2.5% from pre-announcement, when sUSDe is already getting 5% at the current rate - not to mention possible increases from this point
>  
> 🔹@plasma sUSDe, which is trading at ~9.1% Implied APY, only a 1% APY premium considering the current Underlying APY of 8.15% - WITHOUT accounting for possible increases too
>  
> TL;DR
>  
> Even without accounting for possible yield increase for sUSDe, some YTs might be already be trading at below market value.
>  
> IF you're BULLISH and speculating for yield/funding increases, these become no-brainer to position for exposure

> : ̗̀➛  Been diving deep into @pendle_fi  Finance and this project is reshaping DeFi in ways most people don't realize
>  
> ֍   Here's what I discovered which will amazed your mind
>  
> ✦ The Origin Story of this great project
>  
> ⪼ Founded by @tn_pendle
> ➥ who was part of the original Kyber Network team
>  
> ⪼ What started as an experiment in yield tokenization has become
>  
> ➥ the world's largest crypto yield trading platform with a staggering journey from $250M to over $8.3B TVL in 2024 2025
>  
> ✦ The ' real ' Problem They're Solving
>  
> ⪼ Traditional DeFi locks you into fixed yield rates
>  
> ⪼ Pendle breaks this by splitting yield bearing assets into
> ➺ Principal Tokens (PT) and
> ➺ Yield Tokens (YT)
>  
> ⪼ Think of it as DeFi's answer to TradFi's $120 trillion interest rate derivatives market
>  
> ✦ What Makes Them Different then others..
>  
> •⪼  Tokenizes future yield into tradable assets
>  
> •⪼  Users can lock in fixed rates OR speculate on variable yields
>  
> •⪼  No lock up periods unlike traditional staking
>  
> •⪼ Custom AMM designed specifically for yield trading with concentrated liquidity
>  
> ✦ Hidden Detail Most Miss and then regret
>  
> ⪼ Pendle launched Boros in early 2025
>  
> ➥ a yield derivatives platform that lets you trade perpetual funding rates
>  
> ➥ Within 48 hours of launch, Boros attracted $1.85M in BTC/ETH deposits and now handles $35M daily open interest
>  
> ✦ The Numbers Don't Lie so believe in fact
>  
> ⪼ TVL jumped from $5B to $8.9B in just one month (Aug 2025)
>  
> ⪼ Captures over 50% of the entire DeFi yield sector
>  
> ⪼ 5x larger than next biggest competitor
>  
> ⪼ PENDLE token surged 45% to $5.60 post Boros launch
>  
> ⪼ Active on Ethereum, Arbitrum, BNB Chain, Optimism
>  
> ✦ Team & Leadership who made this project at this level
>  
> ⪼ TN Lee leads the vision
> ➥ former Kyber Network founding member with deep TradFi and blockchain experience
>  
> ⪼ The team has built institutional grade infrastructure that's attracting both retail and professional traders
>  
> ✦ Competitors but no competition
>  
> ⪼ While protocols like Aave and Compound focus on lending
> ➥ Pendle created an entirely new category
>  
> ⪼  They're not competing with existing players they're building the infrastructure that other protocols can use
>  
> ✦ What's special Coming
>  
> ⪼ Boros expansion to SOL, BNB and integration with exchanges like Hyperliquid
>  
> ⪼  The roadmap shows they're building DeFi's fixed income layer, targeting institutions moving from TradFi to crypto
>  
> ⪼ This isn't just another yield farming protocol
> it's financial infrastructure that bridges traditional finance concepts with DeFi innovation
>  
> ⪼ The growth metrics speak volumes about product market fit

> While Pendle is a yield-trading platform, it plays a much bigger role in making the broader DeFi ecosystem efficient.
>  
> Not sure what I mean?
> Let's see what Pendle x @aave x @ethena_labs can do on @Plasma.
>  
> Firstly, let's take a look at USDe on Aave.
> Notably, this bad boy only generates 2.28% APR. This means lenders must be willing to support below risk-free yields when depositing which can be detrimental to total deposits.
>  
> sUSDe yields are highly reflexive to sUSDe's staking rates since yield from the whole (USDe backing) is distributed to a minority (USDe staked as sUSDe)
> Having multiple external liquidity sinks for USDe is highly beneficial to Ethena:
> 1. Higher sUSDe yields
> 2. More attractive looping
> 3. Greater USDe supply
>  
> To make Aave a better sink, we need to grow USDe supply rates - similar to how they've done for USDe on mainnet.
> The best way to do this is executing the same playbook we've ALREADY done.
>  
> What's that?
> Getting PT-USDe/sUSDe listed as collateral on Aave Plasma!
>  
> Due to the amplified collateral yields of PTs, they're more accepting borrowers against higher rates. We've seen native rates climb to upwards of 5-8% which is extremely competitive for USDe lending.
>  
> It should go without saying that the good lads at Aave are ALREADY in the process of getting PT-USDe and PT-sUSDe listed on Plasma.
>  
> With 3 (you read that right) layers of incentives to YT holders, expect PT rates to be EXTREMELY attractive.
>  
> That means:
> 1. More yield for USDe on Aave
> 2. More yield for sUSDe and USDe supply for Ethena
> 3. More opportunities for Pendle enjoyooors
>  
> Pendle Aave Ethena Plasma

> The Simplest Way to Maximize stcUSD Yield With @pendle_fi  (up to 65% APY)
>  
> PTs stand for Principal Tokens, but it's easier to understand them as "Predictable Tokens" because you can essentially predict the return you will get.
>  
> Because PT yield is independent of market conditions, it provides a steady, fixed return that is redeemable in full at maturity.
>  
> With this in mind, here are the simplest ways you can utilize PTs in your yield strategy:
>  
> Strategy 1: Hold PT-stcUSD
> - 1) Go to app.pendle.finance/trade/mar…
> - 2) Connect your wallet
> - 3) Swap for output (At current rates, the APY is 15%)
> - Risks to consider: PTs are meant to be held until maturity. If, for whatever reason, you decide to sell early, you may incur a loss. In addition, by holding PT tokens, you assume all smart contract risk associated with stcUSD dependencies and Pendle itself.
>  
> Strategy 2: Leverage PT-stcUSD on @0xspiralstake
> - 1) Acquire USDC or PT-stcUSD (see Strategy 1)
> - 2) Go to app.spiralstake.xyz/products…
> - 3) Decide how much you want to loop (leverage)
> - 4) Click "Leverage" and execute the transaction (At current rates, Net APY is 15%)
> - Risks to Consider: Same as Strategy 1, with the extra caveat that the more you loop, the higher chance you have of being liquidated. Giving yourself a buffer is the best way to mitigate this. In addition, if borrowing rates become higher than the yield, your return can flip negative.

> Easy Strategy for @pendle_fi
>  
> 1. Safe & Steady (Low Risk)
>  
> Buy USDai PT (38.25% fixed yield) or sUSDai PT (30.39%)
> Just hold to maturity → guaranteed yield
> Good for stable, no stress farming
>  
> 2. Speculative Play (High Risk, High Reward)
>  
> Try YT sUSDe (7.7% implied yield)
> If rates go up, ROI can 3x+
> Higher risk, only put small % of portfolio
>  
> 3. Balanced Income (Medium Risk)
>  
> Provide liquidity in USDe/sUSDe pool (9.5–13.5% APY)
> Boost with vePENDLE multipliers or Penpie
> Steady flow + bonus points
>  
> Suggested Mix
>  
> 70% → Fixed PTs (USDai, sUSDai)
> 20% → YT speculation (sUSDe)
> 10% → LP pools with boosts
>  
> In short :
>  
> Lock PTs for safe yield → sprinkle YT for upside → add LP for steady rewards
>  
> PT = Safe fixed yield
> YT = High risk yield bet
> LP = Steady income from providing liquidity
>

> A few reasons why these 4 stablecoin pools on @pendle_fi are so 🔥 right now by @USDai_Official and @gaib_ai
>  
> 1⃣ Both protocols offer yield-bearing synthetic dollars backed by lending to GPUs used for AI compute, plus other neocloud providers -- a real-life business with nice margins!
> 2⃣ Both protocols are pre-TGE so there's big speculative demand buying up their YTs, which drives down the price of PTs, meaning a higher fixed yield to lock in for PT buyers
> 3⃣ There's deep liquidity to buy PTs/YTs and larger trade Pendle trade volume (much larger for USDai)
> 4⃣ Each PT below (excluding PT-AIDaUSDC) currently has competitive borrow rates on curated lending/borrowing markets (8-13%) like @MorphoLabs which means loopers can generate 100-200% APY going near max leverage of 10-11x
> 5⃣ Each PT offers 30 or 51 days left to lock in the fixed yield. That's a nice maturity to allow you to farm for 1-2 months without overcommitting to longer durations.

> Funding rate is one of the most powerful passive income streams in crypto

>  
> Ethena takes advantage of this by opening delta-neutral short positions (ETH, BTC, and other altcoins) on CEXs like Binance and Bybit.

> When I search for Pendle PTs, I often look for yields that can lock in for longer durations, 60-120 days.
>  
> But given the demand to buy YTs in the final days and weeks for pools related to pre-TGE protocols, there are some higher PT fixed yields I could see rotating in and out of to maximize stablecoin yield.
>  
> Remember, if someone buys up YTs, then the price of the YT goes up, and so does the pool PT yield. More YT buying leads to higher YT price, leads to lower PT price, leads to higher fixed yield locked in.
>  
> Just an observation about maybe prioritizing your time in shorter duration PTs vs gunning for long term yields.
>  
> Example below is a little extreme with just 2 days left, but imagine if those higher yields were available with 7-14 days left for PT-sUSDe.

> Fun way to think about PT-USD is a protected put:
> - Long asset -> win if up, lose if down
> - PT-USD -> win if down AND up (within reason), lose if up bigly
>  
> At this stage of the cycle, it's important to consider:
> 1. How hard has something ran?
> 2. How much further can it run?
> 3. What is the potential downside?
>  
> If you're using BTC as a target asset, you can compare PT RoIs against BTC price targets at different time frames.
> You can then plot these target prices back on the BTC/USD charts.
> Its very possible the sucker can maintain momentum and blast through your targets.

> But if it doesn't... will you be ready?

> every staking derivative that launches, every rwa token that comes online, every new yield strategy that gets built – they all flow through pendle eventually. vependle holders collect fees on all of it.
