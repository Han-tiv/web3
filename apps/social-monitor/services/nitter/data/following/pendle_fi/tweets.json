On Pendle, yields of similar or even better magnitude are already available, with arguable more compelling risk profiles.\n\nTo-date, Pendle has already settled over $69.8 billion of fixed yield, proving that the infrastructure works and the demand exists.\n\nThat’s why Fixed Yield is becoming the gateway for institutional participation in crypto. It’s familiar enough for traditional players to understand, yet innovative enough to unlock the next era of finance, one defined by transparency, composability, and accessibility.\n\nPendle has already become the foundation for yield in DeFi. Across major ecosystems, funds, and protocols rely on Pendle to price, trade, and manage yield exposure.\n\nNow, we’re building the infrastructure and compliance framework to bring that same access to the traditional world at scale.\n\nThe $140 trillion global fixed income market shows the world’s appetite for stable yield is massive. What’s missing is a unified venue where every form of yield, from DeFi, CeFi, and TradFi, can converge.\n\nThat’s what Pendle is here to build.\n\nNot just a platform for crypto yield, but the foundation for the world’s yield economy.",

Data from DefiLlama and Pendle show the protocol dominates 80% of the top-yield pools on Plasma.\n\nCurrently, Pendle offers the highest base yields - around 27% through PT-sUSDai and PT-USDai, which occupy the top two positions.\n\nPendle also commands 14% of Ethena's stablecoin TVL on Plasma.\n\nNext up: Pendlethenaave is coming to Plasma. The @ethena_labs  x @aave proposal aims to onboard Ethena PT assets on Aave, soon to be approved.\n\nThis will unlock looping opportunities with PT-sUSDe and PT-USDe, potentially accelerating capital efficiency across Plasma's liquidity ecosystem.\n\nPlasmaavethena = Plasma x Aave x Ethena❌\nPendllasmaavethena = Pendle x Plasma x Aave x Ethena✅",

      "content": "USDai's upward depeg is a fascinating case study into stablecoin mechanics, PT <> YT flows, and basic economic principles that underpin DeFi.\n\nWTF is intern waffling about?\nLet me break this SILLINESS down and how YOU could have capitalized.\n___________________________________________________\n\nUnlike MOST depegged stablecoins, USDai by @USDai_Official depegged in an UPWARD direction. What this means is that traders are currently willing to pay more than $1 for something that should be valued EXACTLY $1.\n\nYour first instinct is probably \"what type of regard is buying $1 for more than $1\" and I'd USUALLY be in agreeance.\n\nThe difference is that holding USDai gives users Allo Points which are being 'priced in' to the standard $1/USDai value.\n\n\"But wait... shouldn't every stablecoin with points also be valued > $1 then?\"\n\n___________________________________________________\n\nTo answer this question, we need to understand how stablecoins maintain peg in the first place. The most common method is using a Peg Stability Module (PSM) which allows users to arbitrage mispricings while returning the stablecoin to peg:\n1. Price < $1 → users buy stablecoin and redeem for $1 of underlying (or something similar)\n2. Price > $1 → users mint stablecoin and sell for > $1\n\nWe are in Scenario 2. for USDai but there is an issue - USDai caps are fully filled so arbitrageurs CANNOT mint more to return it to peg!\n\nThe surge in demand for USDai's Allo Points WITHOUT the ability for new mints disrupts the stablecoin equilibrium.\n\nAs a result, USDai SHOULD be expected to be ABOVE peg until caps are raised.\n___________________________________________________\n\nThe next thing you may have noticed is USDai's Implied Yield running to an absolutely SILLY 51.6% fixed APY, by far one of the highest yielding stables on the platform.\n\nThere is something CRITICAL to note here - Pendle prices assets in terms of the UNDERLYING token.\n\nIn our case, it is USDai which is currently trading at $1.06.\nA 51.6% fixed APY is based on this $1.06 face value.\n\nWhat does this mean for you?\n> Buying PT-USDai will let you capture a fixed yield if you are ALREADY holding USDai.\n> If you are swapping in from USDC, there is a chance you'll end up with a loss in the event USDai repegs from $1.06 → $1\n\nDEFINITELY exercise caution if you plan on entering PTs now.\n___________________________________________________\n\nOne thing that is VERY interesting indeed is that if you were an early YT-USDai buyer, you are up heavily on both implied yield AND USDai/USD.\n\nThis should make sense since:\n1. IY has spiked heavily from ~20% → 51.6%\n2. USDai has depegged upwards from $1 → $1.06\n\nWhile a large component of this IY spike can be attributed to demand for Allo Points, the rest is due to something a widdle bit more structural.\n\nRecall that the thing that affects IY is trading activity of YT and PT:\n1. IY ⏫ if people buy YT OR sell PT\n2. IY ⏬ if people sell YT OR buy PT\n\nIn our case, we have PLENTY of people buying YTs.\nWe do NOT have many people buying PTs since PTs are depegged upwards.\n\nThis means we're ultimately left with IYs that we can expect to continue an upward trajectory AT LEAST until USDai's underlying caps are raised!\n\n___________________________________________________\n\nThis is a neat little lesson into how caps on stablecoins can:\n1. Cause price to depeg in an upward direction\n2. Cause IY to spike in an upward direction\n3. Both without standard market dynamics to bring them back to normal\n\nIf you are able to identify similar set-ups on Pendle's underlying stablecoins, it could VERY MUCH be possible to captures these opportunities.\n\nIntern for one will be keeping a VERY close eye on said protocols and see where dem money bags be lying.\n\nNFA NLA NMA MDMA\n\nPendle",

This means lenders must be willing to support below risk-free yields when depositing which can be detrimental to total deposits.\n\nsUSDe yields are highly reflexive to sUSDe's staking rates since yield from the whole (USDe backing) is distributed to a minority (USDe staked as sUSDe)\nHaving multiple external liquidity sinks for USDe is highly beneficial to Ethena:\n1. Higher sUSDe yields\n2. More attractive looping\n3. Greater USDe supply\n\nTo make Aave a better sink, we need to grow USDe supply rates - similar to how they've done for USDe on mainnet.\nThe best way to do this is executing the same playbook we've ALREADY done.\n\nWhat's that?\nGetting PT-USDe/sUSDe listed as collateral on Aave Plasma!\n\nDue to the amplified collateral yields of PTs, they're more accepting borrowers against higher rates. We've seen native rates climb to upwards of 5-8% which is extremely competitive for USDe lending.\n\nIt should go without saying that the good lads at Aave are ALREADY in the process of getting PT-USDe and PT-sUSDe listed on Plasma.\n\nWith 3 (you read that right) layers of incentives to YT holders, expect PT rates to be EXTREMELY attractive.\n\nThat means:\n1. More yield for USDe on Aave\n2. More yield for sUSDe and USDe supply for Ethena\n3. More opportunities for Pendle enjoyooors\n\nPendle Aave Ethena Plasma",

      "content": "The Simplest Way to Maximize stcUSD Yield With @pendle_fi  (up to 65% APY)\n\nPTs stand for Principal Tokens, but it's easier to understand them as \"Predictable Tokens\" because you can essentially predict the return you will get. \n\nBecause PT yield is independent of market conditions, it provides a steady, fixed return that is redeemable in full at maturity. \n\nWith this in mind, here are the simplest ways you can utilize PTs in your yield strategy:\n\nStrategy 1: Hold PT-stcUSD\n- 1) Go to app.pendle.finance/trade/mar…\n- 2) Connect your wallet\n- 3) Swap for output (At current rates, the APY is 15%)\n- Risks to consider: PTs are meant to be held until maturity. If, for whatever reason, you decide to sell early, you may incur a loss. In addition, by holding PT tokens, you assume all smart contract risk associated with stcUSD dependencies and Pendle itself.\n\nStrategy 2: Leverage PT-stcUSD on @0xspiralstake \n- 1) Acquire USDC or PT-stcUSD (see Strategy 1)\n- 2) Go to app.spiralstake.xyz/products…\n- 3) Decide how much you want to loop (leverage)\n- 4) Click \"Leverage\" and execute the transaction (At current rates, Net APY is 15%)\n- Risks to Consider: Same as Strategy 1, with the extra caveat that the more you loop, the higher chance you have of being liquidated. Giving yourself a buffer is the best way to mitigate this. In addition, if borrowing rates become higher than the yield, your return can flip negative.\n\nI plan to write more posts like this in the future, but please note that everything written here is purely educational and not intended as financial advice.

      "content": "A few reasons why these 4 stablecoin pools on @pendle_fi are so 🔥 right now by @USDai_Official and @gaib_ai\n\n1⃣ Both protocols offer yield-bearing synthetic dollars backed by lending to GPUs used for AI compute, plus other neocloud providers -- a real-life business with nice margins!\n2⃣ Both protocols are pre-TGE so there's big speculative demand buying up their YTs, which drives down the price of PTs, meaning a higher fixed yield to lock in for PT buyers\n3⃣ There's deep liquidity to buy PTs/YTs and larger trade Pendle trade volume (much larger for USDai)\n4⃣ Each PT below (excluding PT-AIDaUSDC) currently has competitive borrow rates on curated lending/borrowing markets (8-13%) like @MorphoLabs which means loopers can generate 100-200% APY going near max leverage of 10-11x\n5⃣ Each PT offers 30 or 51 days left to lock in the fixed yield. That's a nice maturity to allow you to farm for 1-2 months without overcommitting to longer durations.\n\nIf you're interested to learn more, check out these 4 pools under the \"Markets\" tab on Pendle:\n\nExpiring in 51 days on Arbitrum\nPT-USDai\nPT-sUSDai\n\nExpiring in 30 days on Ethereum\nPT-AIDaUSDT\nPT-AIDaUSDC\n\n🔗 app.pendle.finance/trade/mar…",

Historically, we're basically in the FREE $ENA price range now.\n\nAlso, YT buyers at this level have never, ever, never realized losses.\n\nThat said, prior results are not necessarily indicative of future outcomes so... NFA\n\n2) PT-sUSDe\n\nLoop on @aave @MorphoLabs for up to 50% APY.\n\nA stablecoin. 50% APY.\n\nFor a stablecoin. Let that sink in.\n\n3) LP\n\nPretty OP, underrated strategy.\n\nThink about it - you're getting 9.5% APY minimum, up to 13.5% max APY if you hold vePENDLE (or deposit the LP in a liquid locker).\n\nThat's higher than the native sUSDe yield.\n\nPlus, you're also getting 20x Sats (~16.8x when adjusted to SY ratio in your LP position).\n\nLike PT, this is \"full capital protection\" with zero IL when held to maturity, and it gives you $ENA airdrop exposure 🤷🏻\n\nBut hey, why would anyone listen to the ramblings of this Intern anyway hahahaha.\n\nNFA amigos ✌🏻",
