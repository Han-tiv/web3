Some might call it ridiculous to even call that a “meta,” but it’s good to see the space finally waking up to the fact that productivity and cash flow are what truly matter.\n\nBetter late than never.\n\nCEXs have shown for a decade now what’s possible, but now it’s time for onchain protocols to catch up.\n\nThis was my thesis from day one, when Moonrock came in as one of the earliest backers almost 1.5 years ago.\n\nInfinex is building the first true onchain superapp, with perps powered by Hyperliquid, swaps, yield, games, NFTs, and prediction markets all slowly but surely coming together - the vision is turning into reality.\n\nA full CEX experience, minus the custodial risk.\n\nOnce we’re there, the playbook is simple:\n\ngenerate revenue → diversify streams → double down on what users want most → generate even more revenue → TGE → buy back → return value to users.\n\nThe revenue wars have just begun. Also with CEXs getting more FUD than ever, people are finally realizing they need real alternatives.\n\nInfinex is here to win both of these races.",

I honestly don’t get how people are still sidelined here, this opportunity is a blessing.\n\nLet me explain why:\n\nThe next 3–6 months are shaping up to be max bullish and risk-on. Projects that will generate the most momentum and attention will also be the biggest winners.\n\nThis will happen through a series of fundamental upgrades for Infinex that are about to roll out, the result of 6–12 months of hard work behind the scenes:\n\n- Infinex Predict\n- Infinex NFT\n- Infinex Perps / Hyperliquid integration\n- Native $SUI support\n- Infinex browser extension\n- Fiat on-ramp\n\nCombine that with the following catalysts:\n\n- Retail is coming, hence a wave of new users Infinex can capture\n\n- DeFi will thrive in up-only conditions as activity, volume & fees turn reflexive\n\n- From @kaiynne podcasts/interviews, it’s clear their TGE is still coming this year, so expecting a big marketing push and momentum ramp-up\n\nThere are a ton more reasons I’m bullish on Infinex as the main DeFi play, but I’ll leave it here before this turns into a novel.\n\nSo yeah, screenshot this and keep dumping your Patron NFTs at ridiculous prices. We’ll keep buying them.\n\nWinning isn’t for everyone.",
