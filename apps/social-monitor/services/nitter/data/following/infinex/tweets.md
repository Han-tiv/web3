> Great write-up from @kaiynne about his superapp thesis and how he plans to win that game with Infinex.
>  
> After years of empty narratives, real revenue has finally become crypto’s defining meta. Some might call it ridiculous to even call that a “meta,” but it’s good to see the space finally waking up to the fact that productivity and cash flow are what truly matter.
>  
> Better late than never.
>  
> CEXs have shown for a decade now what’s possible, but now it’s time for onchain protocols to catch up.
>  
> This was my thesis from day one, when Moonrock came in as one of the earliest backers almost 1.5 years ago.
>  
> Infinex is building the first true onchain superapp, with perps powered by Hyperliquid, swaps, yield, games, NFTs, and prediction markets all slowly but surely coming together - the vision is turning into reality.
>  
> A full CEX experience, minus the custodial risk.
>  
> Once we’re there, the playbook is simple:
>  
> generate revenue → diversify streams → double down on what users want most → generate even more revenue → TGE → buy back → return value to users.
>  
> The revenue wars have just begun. Also with CEXs getting more FUD than ever, people are finally realizing they need real alternatives.
>  
> Infinex is here to win both of these races.

> Picked up another 10 Infinex Patrons over the past week through some lowball bids that impatient mayo hands dumped into.
>  
> Not sure why you guys hate money, but thanks I guess.
>  
> It’s slowly but surely becoming my biggest bag in the portfolio. I honestly don’t get how people are still sidelined here, this opportunity is a blessing.
>  
> Let me explain why:
>  
> The next 3–6 months are shaping up to be max bullish and risk-on. Projects that will generate the most momentum and attention will also be the biggest winners.
>  
> This will happen through a series of fundamental upgrades for Infinex that are about to roll out, the result of 6–12 months of hard work behind the scenes:
>  
> - Infinex Predict
> - Infinex NFT
> - Infinex Perps / Hyperliquid integration
> - Native $SUI support
> - Infinex browser extension
> - Fiat on-ramp
>  
> Combine that with the following catalysts:
>  
> - Retail is coming, hence a wave of new users Infinex can capture
>  
> - DeFi will thrive in up-only conditions as activity, volume & fees turn reflexive
>  
> - From @kaiynne podcasts/interviews, it’s clear their TGE is still coming this year, so expecting a big marketing push and momentum ramp-up
>  
> There are a ton more reasons I’m bullish on Infinex as the main DeFi play, but I’ll leave it here before this turns into a novel.
>  
> So yeah, screenshot this and keep dumping your Patron NFTs at ridiculous prices. We’ll keep buying them.
>  
> Winning isn’t for everyone.

> There’s one sentence here that stood out to me and here are my thoughts on it:
>  
> “The timeline was overwhelmed by low-quality content. Bots destroyed the network effects of legitimate content creators.”
>  
> This is a very interesting observation.
>  
> Not long ago, when my favorite creators spoke about an ecosystem, it would push me to genuinely explore further.
>  
> But now that I think about it, it’s been a while since I’ve studied an ecosystem deeply.
>  
> Those same creators I used to pause for and study their content and breakdowns, I now skip.
>  
> And that’s because what appeared back then as authentic interest has become incentivized shilling.
