> if you believe in bull market, @virtuals_io is your leverage with a few ways to farm.
>  
> 1. stake $VIRTUAL for 2 years.
> 1 $VIRTUAL == 3 points per day
> 1 point == $0.02
>  
> 10k $VIRTUAL == $17k == 30k points daily == $600 daily.
> 30 days to cover your initial port ++ you'll have $VIRTUAL locked for 2 years (free size).
>  
> 2. buy the dip on agents.
> if you believe in bull and AI -- that's the easiest play. invest in those you believe, stake and farm points.

> with ACP coming it could be interesting, with potential listings of agents on CEXs + more exposure.
