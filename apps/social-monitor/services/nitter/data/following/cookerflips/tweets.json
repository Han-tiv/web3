My family gambled away everything we've had. The years before all I've ever known was moving from one basement to another of someone else's home cuz that's all my parents could afford to rent. It's funny growing up I legit thought this shit was normal until I started to be extra confused why all my friends lived in the same place for 5+ years lmfao. Looking back, I truly learned life isn't fair, but your circumstances doesn't have to define who you are. And let me tell you, summers in NYC surviving on $5 a week is no fking fun. Promised myself at the time I'll never return to that life ever again if I could make it out.\n\nAnyways don't wanna yap much, thank you guys for everything. As much as CT is full of shitheads and drama this and that, I'm truly grateful.\n\nMuch love to @PastelAlpha and all you on here.",

I'm blessed to have money outside of crypto, diff sources of income, a business and of course spot holdings. This is why I always preach YOU NEED TO BE DIVERSIFIED YOU NEED TO HAVE A STUPID FAT CUSHION TO LIVE ON. Funny enough I did stable like $1m+ cuz I was prepping stuff for family, had a fat credit card bill, and window shopping for a 720s 🤣 consider myself lucky cuz I literally did it hours before, too bad I didn't do more, oh well.\n\nIn that moment I reminded myself \"this is the potential loss if market continues to go down, I'm not willing to add more margin from this point on\". \n\nWhere we go from here? \n\nYou know it's crazy coming from 2016-2017, I always imagined the post ICO crash would never happen again and in a way it hasn't technically. -90% drawdown on majors prob wouldn't ever happen again considering institutional involvement. But to see such a violent reaction from alts shows how heavily levered people were in the wrong things (SUI, ATOM to name a few). \n\nBut if any of yall know me I've been chugging along for years now, if I'm down 6-7 figs I'm still grinding. If I'm up 6-7 figs I'm still grinding. Does it suck, yea ofc, but like I say to everyone who needs encouragement, you made it there once you can FUCKING DO IT AGAIN.\n\nMany of you got a good head on your shoulders, take a break, come back stronger, with every flush event (even this one) more opportunities will arise. I'm still here in @PastelAlpha, if anyone needs a push in the right direction I'm right here frens. We stay grinding on the trenches, we take breaks, we focus on our health, we shitpost and we run it back turbo (not really more like slowly and surely).\n\nAnyways shoutout to some of the homies checking up on me I love yall so much, crazy to think we're just strangers online but people care a lot about each other and that's the bright side of things. @ShockedJS @NachSOL @Fredis @kavosiss @onChainPharoh @0xLungin \n\nBut yea I'm mentally fine LMAO as fucked as it sounds this is the benefit of being emotionally numb to money, sometimes I wish I wasn't this way frfr\n\nWhat we know:\n- Biggest liquidation in crypto history over 20B+ \n- Cascading liquidations not only wiped long positions but also ADL kicked in for a lot of people's delta neutral hedges, recipe for disaster a lot of accounts were wiped\n- Hyperliquid worked as intended, Lighter was down for period of time, Aster & Binance also had issues\n- Potential (I'm gonna say confirmed honestly) insider trading on notable onchain wallet profited over 200m in shorts, prob a lot more across all platforms\n- Wintermute + Ethena are operational\n\ntl;dr: yap yap",

In the world of trading, Qi is the pulse of the market - the invisible current that moves prices, sentiment, and opportunity. \n\nThe life force of the trenches. \nJust as ancient masters learned to harness Qi through discipline and awareness, today’s traders channel market energy through intuition, timing, and conviction.\n\nWhen you understand Qi, you see that trading isn’t war - it’s balance. You don’t conquer volatility; you ride its breath. To trade with Qi is to align discipline with instinct, data with intuition, motion with meaning.\n\nThe flow is always there.\nThose who master it, rise with it.",

      "content": "End goal isn’t to work forever, especially not for a necessary income; of course we love having passion projects throughout life but always consider how you’re gonna set yourself up in the future.\n\nYou should always strive for a way to make money while you’re asleep. Something that doesn’t hinge on the fact you need to be active in order for it to work. Ideally it’s consistent enough it doesn’t require capital injection (like yields don’t count).\n\nYou should also want an income where you always win. Generally speaking this requires capital investment upfront; decent rule of thumb or at least from personal experience is break even within 1-2 years and ride free off dividends (comes in many forms).\n\nYou should also look for income sources where the effort is highly disproportionate to the return. These tend to be a bit more rare but can be used as throw away capital or cushion for riskier investments (ex. Brand deals, one time contractual work etc.) If you’re the best at what you do you can charge obscene amounts.\n\nYields are important, boring ofc, high usage of capital, low returns but consistent expected values. \n\nThrowaway Hail Marys, these are like less than 1% of your net worth attempts at 100x returns. You don’t do many of these and generally don’t actively seek them out. But if you get lucky it may provide you all of the above in the long run.",
