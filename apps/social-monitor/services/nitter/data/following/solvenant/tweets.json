      "content": "10 On-chain Trading Rules \n\nNot advice, but writing this more as a reminder to myself after many painful losses, fumbles, roundtrips. \n\n1. Your no1 priority as a trader is to protect your capital, market might be hot doesn't mean you let yourself fomo-ing in plays that will rinse your money. \n\n2. Detach all your emotions out of your portfolio number, adjust your risk so that no loss should fuck up ur mental - don't oversize trying to \" make it\", slow and steady will win the race even tho that race might be boring but it will never zero you out.\n\n3. Trade the attention, when you see a bubble forming, don't hesitate to add fuel into fire, the early birds are the ones who get the worms . In trading, brutal truth is the crowd is your exit liquidity - not your ally, always sells when every1 fomo-ing at the top.\n\nCrowded trade never plays out well \n\n- example: during BNB euphoria, early bridgers printed while everyone else was still stuck on Sol. Narrative doesn't care about a few seconds delay in txs.\n\n4. Don't overtrade, the more u clicks, the less you think, as quality over quantity always. \n\n5. Laziness kills greatness, instead, spend time to observer everything, do DD on every runner u miss, and reflect on every trades you executed poorly.\n\n6. Cutting loss early, don't let the \"BREAK EVEN\" mindset to lock your capital, what goes down 30% can go down another 50%, and what already down 50% can go down another 80%.\n\n7. Focus on what you can control, accept the risk of nature of trading which is uncertainty, nobody can predict the next candle so learn to focus only ur entry, ur size, ur exit.\n\n8. Monitor everything, don't sit and do nothing\n\n> Any vamps? (better ticker, image, or tech?)\n> Any valid FUD?\n> Any interesting wallets accumulating?\n> How’s the sentiment shifting?\n\n9. Stay humble in winning streaks, but confident in losing streaks. Pride. ego, and self-pitty are ur biggest enemies. The market humbles the proud, but it also never rewards the hopeless.\n\n10. Be comfortable sitting on their hands, for no trades is also a trade. Best traders i know only bid when good set-ups appear, and stay patient most of the time\n\nStay disciplined. Show up daily. The rest takes care of itself. Your success already written among the stars.",

      "content": "The PvP happening in the trenches right now is often senseless and adapting can be incredibly difficult.\n\nThere are so many possibilities to consider:\n\n1) New pair gets vamped by a better coin due to an error (wrong image, ticker, name, etc)\n2) New pair gets vamped for no reason\n3) New pair gets vamped by a more creative concept\n4) First deploy re-vamps the better coin afterwards for no reason\n5) People rotate between the first deploy and the better coin three times\n6) The actual OG vamps for no reason\n7) The actual OG vamps because it's a better coin or already has an established community\n8) People buy the redeployed new pair for no reason and the OG does nothing or gets incinerated\n9) Coin vamps because it's a community\n10) Pump gets vamped by bonk because it's a USD1 or other related narrative\n11) Bonk gets vamped by pump because people randomly decide they don't like it\n12) Coin gets vamped by a relevant dev (fartcoin, useless, etc)\n13) Coin gets vamped by fee donations / better dev\n14) SOL gets vamped by BNB or vice versa\n\nThen you have to predict whether or not people will choose a final winner (they usually don't and everything slow bleeds to zero)\n\nWhat I hate about this is that there's no way to always choose the correct coin with logic. There are so many factors to contemplate that most people completely abandon their own thinking and buy whatever the important KOLs choose.\n\n(If you're one of these people and are unprofitable, what are you doing? Do you want to be exit liquidity? Do your own research and formulate your own opinion about every single coin you buy. Stop being lazy and try to front run people instead of waiting for them to buy or shill it to you.)\n\nRequiring popular wallets or big streamers to promote a narrative unfortunately creates a huge element of luck that kills most forms of strategy. Sometimes the more creative coin wins, sometimes the OG wins, and sometimes the obviously correct coin completely loses. There are no strict guidelines you can use to win the PvP every time - trading is all about attention and the market rotates FAST.\n\nWhat I've learned is that every situation is unique. In order to stay consistent, you have to be open-minded and adapt quickly to each new scenario.\n\n- Don't just base your thesis on what happened last time\n- Only think about your current trade and what catalysts could bring eyes to it right now\n- Stay selective and don't oversize into <100k toppers\n- Remove all of your personal bias, don't cope hold, and don't be stubborn when your coin is proven wrong\n- If you don't see a clear win, it's often better to stay sidelined\n- Focus on PvE narratives\n\nThis thread was more of a note to self but I figured some people might find it insightful 🙂",

      "content": "Take notes for the final phase of this bull market\n\n1/ Don’t DCA in.\nDollar-cost-averaging works early in a cycle. At the end, time is against you. If you’re late, you need conviction bets.\n\n2/ DCA out.\nOn the way up, scale out. Don’t dream about selling the exact top — nobody times it perfectly. Secure wins instead.\n\n3/ Focus on winners.\nCut dead weight. Don’t waste emotional energy on bags that never recovered. Winners compound. Losers drain you.\n\n4/ Don’t lock tokens.\nStaking rewards look good until your tokens are stuck while the bull ends. Flexibility is worth far more than a few extra percent of yield. Liquidity is freedom.\n\n5/ Rotate less.\nThis late in the game, chasing every narrative leads to overtrading. Sit on your hands. You can’t catch them all. Accept missing some.\n\n6/ This is a marathon, not a sprint.\nThe people who make life-changing gains are the ones who preserve capital into the next cycle. Survive first. Wealth is built over multiple cycles.\n\n7/ Don’t baghold exit coins.\nWhen it’s time to leave, don’t wait for tokens that “didn’t pump yet.” Some coins never pump again. Hope is not a strategy.\n\n8/ Cash out regularly.\nDon’t wait for “the big exit.” Take profits steadily. Build trust with your bank — you’ll need them for bigger moves outside of crypto.\n\n9/ Concentrate your bets.\nOver-diversification kills upside. A 100x on $5 won’t change your life. Position sizing matters. Focus on high-conviction plays.\n\n10/ Remember volatility.\nNear the top, swings are violent. Don’t let green candles make you greedy or red candles shake you out. Stick to your plan.\n\n11/ Narratives move fast.\nAI, gaming, RWA, memecoins — narratives rotate weekly. Don’t chase them all. Stick to a few strong themes and ride them with discipline.\n\n12/ Think outside crypto.\nUse this cycle to set up for the next phase of your life. Real estate, businesses, equities — crypto should fund your future, not be your only future.\n\n13/ Know when enough is enough.\nGreed kills more than fear. Have a number where you’ll say “I made it” and commit to it.\n\n14/ This isn’t your last shot.\nCycles repeat. If you miss this one, there will be another. Stay liquid, stay disciplined, stay alive.\n\n15/ The bull makes you rich. The bear keeps you rich.\nDon’t blow it all just because the market feels invincible right now. Discipline is more powerful than luck.\n\nLet’s make the best out of it🫡",

No man can always have adequate reasons for buying or selling stocks daily or sufficient knowledge to make his play an intelligent play.\"\n\n\"One of the most helpful things that anybody can learn is to give up trying to catch the last eighth or the first. These two are the most expensive eighths in the world.\"\n\n\"I have often said that to buy on a rising market is the most comfortable way of buying stocks.\"\n\n\"It never was my thinking that made the big money for me. It always was my sitting. Got that? My sitting tight! It is no trick at all to be right on the market.\n\nYou always find lots of early bulls in bull markets and early bears in bear markets. I've known many men who were right at exactly the right time, and began buying or selling stocks when prices were at the very level which should show the greatest profit. And their experience invariably matched mine that is, they made no real money out of it. Men who can both be right and sit tight are uncommon.\n\nI found it one of the hardest things to learn.But it is only after a stock operator has firmly grasped this that he can make big money.”\n\n\"A stock operator has to fight a lot of expensive enemies within himself.\"\n\n\"If a stock doesn’t act right don’t touch it; because, being unable to tell precisely what is wrong, you cannot tell which way it is going. No diagnosis, no prognosis. No prognosis, no profit.\"\n\n\"The trend is evident to a man who has an open mind and reasonably clear sight, for it is never wise for a speculator to fit his facts to his theories.\"\n\n\"What does a man do when he sets out to make the stock market pay for a sudden need? Why, he merely hopes. He gambles. He runs much greater risks than he would if he were speculating intelligently, in accordance with opinions or beliefs logically arrived at.\"\n\n\"It cost me millions to learn that another dangerous enemy to a trader is his susceptibility to the urgings of a magnetic personality when plausibly expressed by a brilliant mind.\"\n\n\"Do you wish to gamble blindly in the hope of getting a great big profit or do you wish to speculate intelligently and get a smaller but much more probable profit?\"\n\n\"It was the kind of market in which not even a skunk could make a scent.\"\n\n\"Of all speculative blunders there are few greater than trying to average a losing game. Always sell what shows you a loss and keep what shows you a profit.\"",

Journal Every Trade - Track your reasoning, entry, exit, emotions - have some respect for the game and for urself if you really want to be better\n\n2. Kill the FOMO - if you feel rushed- u are likely late. Best execution comes from patience, not chasing \n\n3. Respect Risk Management:\n+) NEVER ever FULLPORT \n+) NEVER risk so much that u lose sleep over it\n+) NEVER risk so much that 1 LOSS wipe out ur ability to trade tmr \n\n4. Big win or Big loss, ur mind should always be stoic, be calm - don't get hyped up like a monkey on drugs or sad as if u likely to die tmr\n\n5. Don't Overtrade - the more u clicks, the less you think - Quality >> Quantity\n\n6. Zoom Out: One bad day doesn't mean you will lose in the next 1000 days\n\n7. Buy into Early Speculation - be aggressive when others afraid to do so, and sell on their heads when they FOMO in\n\n8. Stay Humble in Winning Streaks - Pride and Ego are ur biggest enemies - market will humble u if you don't humble urself \n\n9. Accepting Uncertainty - Focus on what u can control - ur entry, ur size, ur exit - u will never have the complete picture of a coin - learn to act with incomplete data\n\n10. Be Comfortable Doing Nothing - best traders I know sit on their hands most of the time - they only bid when good set-ups appear",
