But in my opinion I think it is always good to show up and trench because there are always plays and you never know when the next is coming. It is definitely more risky now to buy multiple tokens but if you are just watching while sitting on your hands, you can potentially hit those few bangers a day you will win big.\n\nI feel like we need 1 big play like snoofi/wdog and everybody will think we are back. I do believe this will eventually happen, just need to show up and be there. 🤝",
