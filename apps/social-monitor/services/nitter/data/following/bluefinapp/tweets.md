> Introducing the BLUE token buyback program and dashboard!
>  
> Over the years, Bluefin has evolved into a multi-product ecosystem powering trading and liquidity across Sui. Today, it stands as the number one revenue-generating protocol on the network.
>  
> At the center of this growth is BLUE, which coordinates products, partners, and community governance. The buyback program serves as a mechanism to strengthen the DAO treasury and reinforce alignment between protocol adoption and governance.
>  
> From day one, our mission has been to build Bluefin into the most powerful onchain trading venue and ensure that protocol growth supports the long-term sustainability of the ecosystem.

> 3/ Bluefin was born in 2020 with a vision to become the most powerful onchain trading venue, and this started with perps as our flagship product. Perpetual futures are the future of crypto markets, and we are seeing major institutions and companies, such as Robinhood and Coinbase, adopting perps into their core product strategies. Sui provides the scalability and performance needed to support this at a global scale, and Bluefin Pro will lead the way.

> 2/ The migration from the current Beta platform to Bluefin Pro will be part of Bluefin Governance Proposal 2 (BGP-2). Here’s everything you need to know about the migration:
>  
> • July 11: First round of delistings on Beta (SEI, APT, TIA, POL, AVAX, ARB, TRUMP, DEEP, BLUE, SEND)
> • Week of July 15: Early access to Bluefin Pro opens
> • 3 Days After Early Access: Public launch of Bluefin Pro
> • July 29: Second round of delistings on Beta (BTC, ETH, SOL, SUI, WAL). These markets will be listed on Bluefin Pro and will be available for you to re-open your positions.
> • July 31: Sunset of Bluefin Beta
>  
> Please close open positions before each delisting deadline. Positions that have not been closed before the delisting time will be closed at the oracle price. You can continue trading and earning rewards on Beta until July 29. Bluefin Vaults will remain active and continue to earn beyond migration.
>  
> We will be publishing a detailed guide and FAQ in the coming days to help make this migration as smooth as possible for you.

> Bluefin combines the depth of passive LPs with the precision of RFQ (Request for quote) execution. This hybrid model delivers low slippage, MEV protection, and consistently better pricing.
>  
> RFQ is quickly emerging as a core primitive in DeFi. We’re scaling it fast and integrating it directly into our concentrated liquidity pools. This results in tighter spreads, faster fills, and better execution.

> During our ongoing formal verification with our partners at @AsymptoticTech, of integer-mate  – a core math library used across many Sui protocols – we identified an edge case where signed subtraction could behave incorrectly when the second operand reached its minimum possible value.
>  
> While the bug had no impact on Bluefin’s systems, the uncertainty around how others might use the library prompted us to act quickly - preparing an improved implementation with our security partners and working closely with Sui Foundation to spread the word to affected DEXs so they could fix this bug.
>  
> Thank you to everyone involved: @AsymptoticTech for the deep dive and spotting the edge case, @osec_io’s @NotDeGhost for jumping in on verification, and @SuiNetwork for leading a swift and coordinated response.
>  
> This is the kind of collaboration that sets Sui apart. Security is an ongoing commitment, and this quick identification and solve shows we're in this together.
>  
> We’ll continue investing in formal verification, architecture reviews, and ecosystem-wide coordination to raise the bar for secure and verifiable DeFi.

> 6/ To date, we have completed six third-party audits across our AMM, perpetuals, and vaults infrastructure. We are expanding that scope, not just to what we build, but to every protocol we interact with.

>  
> • Internal red teaming
> • Formal verification
> • Incentive-driven discovery
> • Runtime circuit breakers
>  
> Security isn’t something we “have.” With every product released and increasing user deposits, it’s something we continually build. This is how we shift left, stay vigilant, and make Bluefin harder to break by design.

We’ve been live on @HackenProof since 2024, and have now significantly increased rewards to incentivize responsible disclosure. We are also publishing internal threat models to broaden the attack surface whitehats can meaningfully engage with. Combined with economic modelling, they form a parallel layer of defence that scales as we do.

> 4/ We are also evolving our runtime defence posture. Drawing inspiration from DeFi primitives like Compound’s guardian actor, timelocks, and circuit breakers, each Bluefin protocol is being hardened with runtime fail-safes that automatically delay or throttle risky actions. For example, large withdrawals that deviate several standard deviations above historical norms will trigger temporary delays. In those windows, the system fails safe – and a multisig guardian can accelerate approval if triage determines the behaviour is valid. These mechanisms are protocol-specific, adaptable, and designed to contain failure before it spreads.
