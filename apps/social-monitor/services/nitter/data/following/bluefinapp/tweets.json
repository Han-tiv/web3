These markets will be listed on Bluefin Pro and will be available for you to re-open your positions.\n• July 31: Sunset of Bluefin Beta\n\nPlease close open positions before each delisting deadline. Positions that have not been closed before the delisting time will be closed at the oracle price. You can continue trading and earning rewards on Beta until July 29. Bluefin Vaults will remain active and continue to earn beyond migration.\n\nWe will be publishing a detailed guide and FAQ in the coming days to help make this migration as smooth as possible for you.",

Drawing inspiration from DeFi primitives like Compound’s guardian actor, timelocks, and circuit breakers, each Bluefin protocol is being hardened with runtime fail-safes that automatically delay or throttle risky actions.

In those windows, the system fails safe – and a multisig guardian can accelerate approval if triage determines the behaviour is valid.
