> @SBF_FTX is correct. If it weren’t for the bankruptcy lawyers, FTX could have paid us all out in-kind just like the Genesis and Gemini bankruptcies did.

> Instead we were dollarized at $16,500 BTC while John J. Ray III paid $1M to each of his newly appointed board members to push through his $42M bonanza bonus package post-confirmation (not part of the bk plan we voted on)

> 9) It isn’t the employee’s fault, when that happens. It isn’t their fault if their employer doesn’t really know what to do with them, or doesn’t really have anyone to effectively manage them. It isn’t their fault if internal politics lead their department to lose its way.
