I’ve already done the work and saved the wallets, but under normal conditions they’re mixed with many others, which makes them harder to identify.\n\nA clear pattern emerges: all the wallets were funded via ChangeNOW and Debridge, around 64 or 75 days ago, with deposits ranging from 1.5 to 5 SOL. Each wallet entered between $300 to $950 at Mcap AVG between 31k and 90k.\n\nNote: this applies only to this specific bundle.\nThe hack appears to have been executed more than one person, which means other wallets may follow different identification patterns.\nHere’s another clear pattern: this cluster all share the same age, were funded by Debridge (not shown here since the wallet was last used 300d ago), and each bought similar amounts at similar Mcap.\n\nAlso, if you hover over the Hold duration section, it reveals the time of the first buy, and for these 3 wallets, the time is identical.

Some of them even developers. Their belief, their conviction, and their community got spat on, by the very person who encouraged them to believe.\n\nTHE FACTS:\n\n- Yes, @peacefuldecay and his team launched several of the OG tickers including $HACHI, $HALO, and others\n\n- Yes, they privated their deployment RPC 10 minutes after the launchpad went live, so no one other than them /  insiders do it.\n\n- Yes, they have done nothing to push their token(s), leaving them up completely for the mercy of the open market, after finding the incentive to launch them.\n\n- Yes, they donated all the fees generated from these coins to ''starseed'' / burned them, further destroying their survivability.\n\n- Yes, all the OG tickers have bled out to irrecoverable levels until their communities died, and as a result, will get sidelined by “starseed”\n\n- Yes, ICO participants / developers have reached out to me to call out @peacefuldecay 's BS, and how he left them in the dark.\n\n- Yes, many of heavens own developers have not received a single dollar of their fees, and neither a single response from their support.\n\nCONCLUSION:\n\n@heavendex  only focused on early FOMO candling $LIGHT to create noise and attract degens intotheir ecosystem, only to farm them to death, and not give up a single dollar for their benefit.\n\nThis is the epitome of greed, and @peacefuldecay is the Anti-Christ of this ecosystem.",

I saw a tweet: “How did someone turn $100 into $100k in $TRUMP?”\n\nI had around $450 in my bank account and only one month of rent left. So, I thought, “Let’s take a risk with $250 and turn it into $250k.”\n\nAt first, I didn’t know about BullX, Photon, or Axiom. I started trading using DexScreener 😭😂. After some research… I LOST IT ALL.\n\nA month passed. I didn’t get a job, my rent money was gone, and I had to return home even though I didn’t want to.\n\nI noticed people with followers on X were earning more. So in February, I started my own X account for crypto.\n\nFirst I came with X of @Euris_x. I didn’t even know about @orangie and @Cupseyy at that time.I did not know what is wallet tracking, what the fhak is KOL.\n\nI thought, “Let’s give it a try. This time I’ll make it.”\nI took a $1000 loan, bought 3 SOL, and subscribed to 1 month of X Premium. LOST 90% of it all.\n\nThen, I came to know about Alpha Groups. My first Alpha Group was @Shocked, which I won in a giveaway from @kbz012 (the best trader and a great human, he has done more for me than anyone else on this planet. I’ll write more about him later in the thread).\nBy March, I had only 0.5 SOL left in my wallet  and an Alpha Group.",

Since it looks like EVERYONE is getting drained by this guy, let me break down exactly how he’s doing it:\n\nStep 1 – The bait:\nHe reaches out asking for “help learning to trade,” offering 20–50 SOL as payment.\n\nStep 2 – The flex:\nOn a Discord call, he shows off a “big wallet,” huge PnL screenshots, and gambling site balances to make himself look legit.\n\nStep 3 – The setup:\nHe asks you to create a new Axiom account. While doing this, he insists you use your mouse to copy/paste everything “so you don’t lose the password.”\n\nStep 4 – The trap:\nWhat he doesn’t tell you is that when you copy/paste with your mouse, your screen flashes the last thing you copied. He’s recording your screen the whole time. That’s how he gets your login info.\n\nStep 5 – The theft:\nHe then has you send SOL to your trading wallet (sometimes even sending some himself to make it seem safe). Once you’re in, he uses the captured info to log into your account and drain it. If you reused the same password elsewhere, he takes those too.\n\nThese guys aren’t “hacker wizards.” \n\nThey’re just exploiting simple human error.\n\nNot blaming victims here at all. It’s a dirty trick and easy to fall for specially when this russian MF does not stop spamming questions non stop.\n\nStay sharp, don’t screen-share sensitive actions, and always protect your info. <3",

Now, they’re just leaving messages on read in DMs with no updates.\n\nAdditionally, there has never been an official announcement of the contest winners,everything is handled only via DMs, making the contest very unclear.\n\nThe Bonk community is still waiting for the official announcement with no news, and winners still haven’t been paid. \n\n@SolportTom , if you truly want a strong community, you should reconsider your priorities.",

He exposes KOLs, scammers, and does top-tier on-chain sleuthing. A true pro who knows exactly what he’s doing. Sadly, he’s not very active anymore, so I recommend scrolling through his older posts. Absolute GOAT.\n\n- @dethective \nBasically the Coffeezilla of Twitter, always going after big fish like Hasbulla, Hayden, JamesWynn & more. He’s extremely consistent, detailed post and and provides clear visuals. You’ll learn a ton from him, straight up a beast.\n\n- @chalkydr1 \nLove this guy, he shares Solscan content and solid threads. His most interesting posts are mostly from 2024, you absolutely need to read them (need to scroll down). He’s basically a wallet-tracking quant.\n\n- @CryptoRugMunch\nThis guy was killing it in 2024. He exposed and called out scams and bundles. He’s not active anymore, but if you scroll through his old posts, you can learn a lot about how rugs work.\n\nOn YouTube:\n\n- @2BashBrothers \nProbably the best YouTube channel to learn insider tracking and cabal. He’s a pro of Solscan and clearly explains how to use it. Take the time to watch his videos, there’s so much to learn.\n\n- @AntoineRSX \nHe’s already well-known, but I still wanted to share his work. His YT videos are clean and high quality, and he really knows his stuff when it comes to on-chain. He also developed a solid tracking tool (@StalkHQ), which drops banger threads too. Dig into his channel, you’ll definitely find videos that will teach you.\n\nAlso, threads from @bubblemaps and @arkham are excellent ways to learn. Read them, understand them and apply how they made their discoveries. Don’t leave a thread without figuring out how they did it, then try doing it yourself.\n\nAnd let's not forget @zachxbt, the undisputed #1.",
