> The ideal way is to take the time to go on Solscan, but that takes much longer, and the goal is to be fast in this kind of situation. That’s why I use GMGN, it makes scam identification extremely clear.
>  
> I always make sure to update the tags on top traders, since they sometimes reuse the same ones.
>  
> Tip: If you notice an empty box in the funding tab, it usually indicates the wallet was funded via Privacy Cash (a mixer).

> A quick post about #TeamWater Hack and how to avoid this kind of scam, easy to spot if you’re using @gmgn.
>  
> First, I go to the Holders and Top Traders tabs and start checking a few things:
>  
> - The AVG Mcap entry
> - Total bought
> - Funding & total funded amount
> - Wallet Age
>  
> The goal is to identify bundles and clusters.
>  
> Now, let’s look at TeamWater in the screenshot. I’ve already done the work and saved the wallets, but under normal conditions they’re mixed with many others, which makes them harder to identify.
>  
> A clear pattern emerges: all the wallets were funded via ChangeNOW and Debridge, around 64 or 75 days ago, with deposits ranging from 1.5 to 5 SOL. Each wallet entered between $300 to $950 at Mcap AVG between 31k and 90k.
>  
> Note: this applies only to this specific bundle.
> The hack appears to have been executed more than one person, which means other wallets may follow different identification patterns.
> Here’s another clear pattern: this cluster all share the same age, were funded by Debridge (not shown here since the wallet was last used 300d ago), and each bought similar amounts at similar Mcap.
>  
> Also, if you hover over the Hold duration section, it reveals the time of the first buy, and for these 3 wallets, the time is identical. Together, they sold over 145M tokens.

> Here are the elements I managed to collect:

> Cupsey funds were transferred manually (2 transfers with a 21-second interval), then bridged to ETH using MAYAN FINANCE, and finally mixed through the Tornado Cash mixer.
>  
> Now, here are 4 other victims who went through EXACTLY the same procedure. Some are linked to the NOVA case but were not reimbursed, since their wallets did not interact with the main drainer’s wallets.

> All incidents occurred between June 30 and September 16.

> @Cupseyy Axiom,Photon,Nova (September 16)
>  
> They all have one app in common: Nova.
>  
> The owners clearly specified the apps they used, so this information is reliable.
>  
> This does not prove 100% that they are guilty, but everything seems to indicate that there was probably a PK leak through Nova. Moreover, they are the only ones who did not use Turnkey.
>  
> A total of $700k was drained with these 5 wallets.

> CHAPTER 3:  DEATH AND DECAY.
>  
> To start off, I apologize for everyone who lost on @heavendex . What started as constructive criticism is now ending with pure disdain. Disdain for someone who did worse than just extract you, they mislead you and indefinitely kept you believing that their is light at the end of the tunnel, when all there was, was darkness.

> I have so far had 20+ people with “heaven tickers” in their bio or PFPs DMing me that they lost all hope. Some of them even developers. Their belief, their conviction, and their community got spat on, by the very person who encouraged them to believe.
>  
> THE FACTS:
>  
> - Yes, @peacefuldecay and his team launched several of the OG tickers including $HACHI, $HALO, and others
>  
> - Yes, they privated their deployment RPC 10 minutes after the launchpad went live, so no one other than them /  insiders do it.
>  
> - Yes, they have done nothing to push their token(s), leaving them up completely for the mercy of the open market, after finding the incentive to launch them.
>  
> - Yes, they donated all the fees generated from these coins to ''starseed'' / burned them, further destroying their survivability.
>

> My Journey in Trench
>  
> In January, when Trump launched his memecoin, I was preparing for a job after being laid off for 7 months. I saw a tweet: “How did someone turn $100 into $100k in $TRUMP?”
>  
> I had around $450 in my bank account and only one month of rent left. So, I thought, “Let’s take a risk with $250 and turn it into $250k.”
>  
> At first, I didn’t know about BullX, Photon, or Axiom. I started trading using DexScreener 😭😂. After some research… I LOST IT ALL.
>  
> A month passed. I didn’t get a job, my rent money was gone, and I had to return home even though I didn’t want to.
>  
> I noticed people with followers on X were earning more. So in February, I started my own X account for crypto.
>  
> First I came with X of @Euris_x. I didn’t even know about @orangie and @Cupseyy at that time.I did not know what is wallet tracking, what the fhak is KOL.
>  
> I thought, “Let’s give it a try. This time I’ll make it.”
> I took a $1000 loan, bought 3 SOL, and subscribed to 1 month of X Premium. LOST 90% of it all.
>  
> Then, I came to know about Alpha Groups. My first Alpha Group was @Shocked, which I won in a giveaway from @kbz012 (the best trader and a great human, he has done more for me than anyone else on this planet. I’ll write more about him later in the thread).
> By March, I had only 0.5 SOL left in my wallet  and an Alpha Group.

> Ok. Since it looks like EVERYONE is getting drained by this guy, let me break down exactly how he’s doing it:
>  
> Step 1 – The bait:
> He reaches out asking for “help learning to trade,” offering 20–50 SOL as payment.
>  
> Step 2 – The flex:
> On a Discord call, he shows off a “big wallet,” huge PnL screenshots, and gambling site balances to make himself look legit.
>  
> Step 3 – The setup:
> He asks you to create a new Axiom account. While doing this, he insists you use your mouse to copy/paste everything “so you don’t lose the password.”
>  
> Step 4 – The trap:
> What he doesn’t tell you is that when you copy/paste with your mouse, your screen flashes the last thing you copied. He’s recording your screen the whole time. That’s how he gets your login info.
>  
> Step 5 – The theft:
> He then has you send SOL to your trading wallet (sometimes even sending some himself to make it seem safe). Once you’re in, he uses the captured info to log into your account and drain it. If you reused the same password elsewhere, he takes those too.
>  
> These guys aren’t “hacker wizards.”
>  
> They’re just exploiting simple human error.
>  
> Not blaming victims here at all. It’s a dirty trick and easy to fall for specially when this russian MF does not stop spamming questions non stop.
>  
> Stay sharp, don’t screen-share sensitive actions, and always protect your info. <3

> Probably my biggest inspiration. He exposes KOLs, scammers, and does top-tier on-chain sleuthing. A true pro who knows exactly what he’s doing. Sadly, he’s not very active anymore, so I recommend scrolling through his older posts. Absolute GOAT.
>  
> - @dethective
> Basically the Coffeezilla of Twitter, always going after big fish like Hasbulla, Hayden, JamesWynn & more. He’s extremely consistent, detailed post and and provides clear visuals. You’ll learn a ton from him, straight up a beast.
>  
> - @chalkydr1
> Love this guy, he shares Solscan content and solid threads. His most interesting posts are mostly from 2024, you absolutely need to read them (need to scroll down). He’s basically a wallet-tracking quant.
>  
> - @CryptoRugMunch
> This guy was killing it in 2024. He exposed and called out scams and bundles. He’s not active anymore, but if you scroll through his old posts, you can learn a lot about how rugs work.
>  
> On YouTube:
>  
> - @2BashBrothers
> Probably the best YouTube channel to learn insider tracking and cabal. He’s a pro of Solscan and clearly explains how to use it. Take the time to watch his videos, there’s so much to learn.
>  
> - @AntoineRSX
> He’s already well-known, but I still wanted to share his work. His YT videos are clean and high quality, and he really knows his stuff when it comes to on-chain. He also developed a solid tracking tool (@StalkHQ), which drops banger threads too. Dig into his channel, you’ll definitely find videos that will teach you.
>  
> Also, threads from @bubblemaps and @arkham are excellent ways to learn. Read them, understand them and apply how they made their discoveries. Don’t leave a thread without figuring out how they did it, then try doing it yourself.
>  
> And let's not forget @zachxbt, the undisputed #1.

> To clarify:
>  
> The data seems to only account for tokens from before the migration, so traders who entered after bond (Raydium or Pumpswap) don’t appear to be included. Only the sells from wallets that entered before the migration are reflected.
>  
> So in this context, "Pump.fun top traders" represents the traders who entered before the migration.

> But the realized profits reflect the total PnL of the wallet, whatever the tokens were sold before or after the migration.

> Example: Cupsey didn’t make $24M PnL just by trading exclusively on Pump.fun non-migrate token, the total includes all realized profits.
