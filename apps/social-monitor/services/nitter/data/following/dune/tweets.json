So many narratives come and go quickly.\n\n* Understand both the bugs and the *features* of the system you are trying to disrupt.\n\n* Startups are a rollercoaster but in crypto, the amplitude is even bigger. It can be gut-wrenching, but also a lot of room for fun and fast learning. That's why one of Dune's company values is...... embrace the rollercoaster! 📷\n\nVideo link in comment 👇",
